Between Jacob and former Pence Chief of Staff, Marc Short, who also testified, last week, they're the two highest- ranking officials, in the former administration, who are now known to have talked. One more piece, in the larger picture, which of course, is dominated by the fact that more than 17 million viewers watched what's been billed as the January 6th committee's season finale. And interest has certainly been high throughout. The question now is whether any of it's changed any minds and, more specifically, whether it could change any votes, in the midterms, this fall, and perhaps 2024? There are some answers. Our one and only Senior Data Reporter, the one and only Harry Enten. Are you seeing any change, in the perception, of the former President, now that the hearings have concluded, for now? HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: One of the things, I've learned, covering President Trump, throughout all of his electoral history, is the more he is in the news, the worse it is for him. So, take a look at his net favorability rating, right? That's his favorable minus his unfavorable. And look at it, since essentially, March. And what do we see? We see that in March of 20 - March 25th, which was essentially four months ago, right? It was minus 6 points. Then it's minus 7 points, April 25th. Then, May 25th, minus 9 points. June 25th, minus 10 points. July 25th, minus 13 points. You don't have to be a mathematician, to know that's a bad trend line. And it follows everything that we know that we've seen in the past. When the President stays out of the news, or the former President, stays out of the news? His numbers go up. When he gets in the news, the numbers go down. COOPER: Interesting. ENTEN: And so, to me, it's a pretty clear trend line. COOPER: What are you seeing among Republicans, in particular? ENTEN: So, if we look among Republicans, in particular, obviously, the thing that I think most Republicans are concerned about, at this point, and specifically, Donald Trump, is most concerned about, is whether or not he can win in 2024, right? Can he win that Republican nomination? And, of course, at this particular point, his main nemesis is Ron DeSantis, the Governor of Florida. And what do we see in the trend line there? If you go back, from last year, what you essentially see is that Donald Trump's numbers have stayed pretty steady, right, in the national primary polls. He was at 53 percent, a year ago. Six months ago, he was at 52 percent. Now, he's at 51 percent. But look at DeSantis' numbers. COOPER: Wow! ENTEN: He's basically coalesced, or beginning to coalesce the anti- Trump vote. He's basically doubled his vote share, over the last year. And this, to me, is a problem, if you're the former President. Because, it essentially says the people, who aren't with Trump, right now, perhaps will never be with him and part - in part, perhaps, because they believe he's unelectable, because he's becoming more unpopular, with the general electorate. COOPER: And the midterms, obviously, are approaching. Are you seeing some trends? ENTEN: We are seeing some trends. So, this is, to me, interesting. Because, to be honest with you, Anderson, I'm the type of person-- COOPER: Please be honest! ENTEN: --I would - I'd rather be honest than not. I lie, perhaps to my mother, when I say, ""Oh, yes, I ate my vegetables."" But beyond that, I'm fairly an honest guy. At least I'm honest, with the viewer. And what we see, in the race, for Congress, right now, is that Republicans hold a lead. But it's a small lead. It's down to a point. If you look back, before the January 6th committee hearings, if you looked at the CNN-approved polls, it was essentially 4 points on average. And I was surprised by this, to be perfectly honest, because I'm the type of guy, who says, ""Ah no one's going to watch these hearings. No one's going to change their mind. This is all about Trump."" COOPER: Right. ENTEN: But, in fact, what we have seen, is that people have been willing to change their minds. And, right now, the Republican lead has been sliced. It's truly a surprise, for me. COOPER: I understand that you think the polls, at this point, might be underestimating the Republican Party? ENTEN: Yes, I do. You know? COOPER: What does it mean? How it's so? ENTEN: Yes, yes, it's a good question. Yes. It's a good question. COOPER: It's why I asked. ENTEN: That's a - that's - you ask the questions. I answer them. So, I'm a student of history, right? I can look at the current poll numbers, get an idea of what's cooking. But I like to look back over time. And what we see essentially is let's just take a look at the elections, since 1994, since I was perhaps, if I stood, I would be, up to maybe your waist, at this point. COOPER: Knee-high. ENTEN: Knee-high. COOPER: Yes. ENTEN: Knee-high. I was a young - I was a young boy, back then. And if you look at the elections, since 1994, where there was a Democratic president, right, just like we have right now, and you compare the July polls, with what actually happened, in the election? We see that, on average, the Republicans outperformed their July polls, and the actual result, by 6 points. COOPER: Wow! ENTEN: They tend to gain from now until the election. The reason for that tends to be - there's tends to be this fade-away from the president's party, right, this presidential penalty? COOPER: Right. ENTEN: And that would make sense, in this particular year, right? Because President Biden's approval rating is stuck in the high-30s. So, if we're going to see movement, you'd probably see movement, away from the President's party. And history suggests that's exactly what's going to happen. Now, I will warn you. History isn't always prologue. COOPER: History is yet to be written! ENTEN: History has yet to be written off! What a lovely phrase that is! But, but, in my particular study of this, I would be quite surprised-- COOPER: Interesting! ENTEN: --if Republicans didn't do considerably better than their polling is right now. But you know what? I was proven once wrong, as we spoke about earlier, in this segment. Perhaps I'll be proven wrong, once again. COOPER: We shall see. Harry Enten, I appreciate it. Thanks. That was really good. ENTEN: I try my best. COOPER: Yes, I liked it. ENTEN: I bring it for you. [21:05:00] COOPER: You brought it, definitely. ENTEN: Thank you. I appreciate it. COOPER: Yes. Perspective now, on all this, as well as the ongoing political sparring, between Mike Pence, and the former President. He'll be speaking, in Washington, tomorrow. His first time, back in D.C., since leaving office, and fomenting an insurrection. Joining us is CNN Chief Political Correspondent, and CNN ""STATE OF THE UNION"" Co-anchor, Dana Bash. Also, Atlantic Staff Writer, McKay Coppins. So, Dana, you heard Harry talk about the cooling effect, the hearings may be having, on the former President's favorability, or having. Whether the former President's going to run or not, obviously, is unclear. I understand, you have some new reporting about Pence's calculations? DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN CO-ANCHOR, STATE OF THE UNION: Is calculation, I'm told, by a source, familiar with the thinking of the former Vice President, is that it doesn't matter, whether his former boss, the former President, actually runs that that won't have an impact, on whether or not he, Mike Pence, decides to run. Having said that, you just saw what Harry laid out, very clearly, when it comes to where the Republican Party is, and more specifically, where the former President is, and how his approval ratings continue to go down. Especially since what we have seen, with the January 6th hearings. It's, what I'm told, is that, when you look at, even some internal numbers, for the former President, the thing that is most striking, is that women, in particular, have fled. That he is doing - Donald Trump is doing, so poorly, with women, and then that has contributed to the unfavorable rating that you're seeing clicking up that Harry just talked about. How that will be determinative, not just if Mike Pence runs but, more importantly, if Donald Trump actually runs? We'll see. COOPER: McKay, we saw these dueling Trump and Pence rallies, in Arizona, in Donie O'Sullivan's piece. Is the former Vice President positioning himself, as an alternative, to Trump, in 2024? I mean, is there a lane for him? MCKAY COPPINS, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC: I think he's betting that there is. I'm not sure whether that's going to turn out to be a good bet. But he is clearly distancing himself, from Trump, to a certain extent, right? He's not disowning Donald Trump. He's not disowning, certainly, Donald Trump's voters. But he's trying to return to his previous place, in the party, which was that of a (inaudible) governor-- COOPER: And so-- COPPINS: And-- COOPER: We've lost your audio, McKay. I'm sorry. Dana, in terms of the Justice Department's investigation, I mentioned earlier, we learned that Marc Short, the former Chief of Staff, for Mike Pence, testified, in front of grand jury, as well as Pence's former General Counsel, Greg Jacob, according to ""The Times"" and ""The Wall Street Journal."" That's a pretty big deal! BASH: It's a huge deal. We have not been entirely sure, where the Department of Justice investigation has been going. And that's a big understatement, I know. The fact that there is a grand jury, and that as part of that, these two very important figures, not just in the Trump administration, but on the day of January 6th, came before, this grand jury? And although Marc Short came on CNN earlier, with Erin Burnett, and was understandably careful, about what to say, about what he said, during the grand jury testimony? The fact that these two figures talked, is telling. And all we have to do is look at the kinds of things that they told the January 6th committee, to understand how deep, their knowledge base is. And obviously, it's connected to the previous conversation, how upset they were, about how the former President, handled himself, in the days, leading up to, and on January 6th, given where they actually physically were, with Mike Pence-- COOPER: Yes. BASH: --trying to make sure that he was safe. COOPER: Yes. McKay, I think we have your audio back. Yes, we're talking about Pence. Does he have a lane? And then, you have DeSantis, who obviously, as we just - Harry was just showing us, has been going - his numbers have been going up. So, does Pence have a lane? COPPINS: Yes, I mean, I don't know, right? The problem for Pence is that most of his political relevance, in the current Republican Party, is through his association with Donald Trump. Now, he is trying to walk this kind of tortured tightrope, where he's disowning (inaudible) about saying that he lost the election. COOPER: Sorry. Again, we lost the audio. McKay Coppins, appreciate it. Dana Bash, as well. [21:10:00] Coming up next, what many consider the most serious immediate legal threat, the former President now faces. New reporting on one Georgia prosecutor's criminal grand jury investigation, the hurdle, a judge overseeing it, just put in her way, and how electoral politics could be complicating it all. And later, Russia fires missiles, at the port in Odessa, just a day after reaching a deal, to allow Ukrainian grain exports. What it means to a hungry world in the larger war? Plus, how our retired Army three- star general sees the state of play, five months, since Russia invaded. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: New developments, tonight, in the election interference criminal probe, in Georgia's Fulton County, including an apparent setback, for the D.A., who's leading it, as well as a victory, and some high-profile testimony. Oh sorry. Kara Scannell joins me. Now Kara, what more can you tell us about this recorded testimony, provided by the Georgia Governor, Brian Kemp? KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, the governor, Kemp, is providing this testimony, today. It's being recorded, and it will be presented to the special grand jury, in the near future. The reason why, he's not sitting, and providing live testimony, is because he is the governor, and it was a concession that the prosecutors had given him. [21:15:00] But his testimony is important, because he had direct conversations, with former President, Donald Trump, after the 2020 election. Trump had called Kemp, and was pushing him, to convene a special session, of the state legislature, to try to get them to overturn Biden's victory. He was also - Trump was also pressing Kemp, to order an audit, of the absentee ballots, on those signatures. Now, Kemp is one of the most high-profile people, to go in. But he won't be the last. Other allies, of the former President, including his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have been ordered to testify, as soon as next month. COOPER: And a judge blocked the Fulton County District Attorney, from investigating one of the 16 fake Trump electors, who's a Republican State Senator, as part of its investigation, into the former President. Do we know more about that? SCANNELL: Yes. So, this judge, in Fulton County, disqualified the Fulton County District Attorney, from investigating Georgia State Senator, Burt Jones. The backstory here is that Jones is a target of this investigation. And he's one of those fake electors. He's also running for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. And this is where the rub is. Fani Willis, the District Attorney, hosted a fundraiser, for his opponents, in that race. The judge said that that was an untenable conflict, and said that Willis, and her office, cannot investigate this senator, cannot include him in the report that the special grand jury will produce. But he said that any actions that do come up, under questioning, can be referred, to a different district attorney. It also doesn't have an impact, on the broader investigation. 11 other fake electors are due to appear, before the special grand jury, this week. COOPER: And a judge denied a request, by Georgia Republican congressman, Jody Hice, to squash a subpoena, to appear, in front of the special grand jury, which is investigating the former President. SCANNELL: That's right. That also came today. There was a court hearing, in Fulton County. The federal judge there, saying that she would not quash this subpoena, for testimony. She said, she would send it to a state judge, where they could confer and figure out the parameters of any questions. We haven't heard from Hice's office, and whether he will appeal. But this is another instance, where Willis is getting some testimony, or possibly some testimony, about some of these key players, in the election. COOPER: Kara Scannell, appreciate it. Thanks. Back with us, again, CNN Chief Legal Analyst, and former federal prosecutor, Jeffrey Toobin. Do you think this investigation, in Georgia, out of all the investigations that the former President is involved, could ultimately be the most consequential? JEFFREY TOOBIN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: It certainly is the one, at the moment that looks like, is most likely to lead to an indictment of the former President. I mean, if you look at how this is being structured, if you look at the infamous phone call that I think most people are familiar with, where the - President Trump called the Secretary of State, Raffensperger, and said, ""Get me 11,000 votes,"" which really is about as clear, almost a confession, of corrupt intent. COOPER: Let's play that. TOOBIN: OK. Yes, I mean, let's hear it, yes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more that we have. Because we won the state. (END VIDEO CLIP) TOOBIN: I mean, he's not saying, ""I want a correct vote total."" COOPER: Right. TOOBIN: He's not saying, ""Let's get this accurate."" He's saying, ""Just get me enough votes, so I win the election."" That is really very difficult to explain. And, if you look at how Fani Willis, is approaching, this case, she's brought everybody in, to this grand jury, or is in the process of doing it. And, she is also an elected official, in a very Democratic part of Georgia. So, she has no real political risk, by pursuing this. COOPER: If, I mean, if charges were brought, by her, against the former President, what happens? TOOBIN: Well, see, this is where the case is potentially, could run into a lot of problems. Georgia has a very unusual legal structure, in terms of these cases, where potentially that case could be forced, into federal court, which would be a very different scenario. Perhaps a different set of prosecutors. Also likely, possible appeals, of that decision, to go to federal court. If she actually indicts the former President, a trial could be at least a year away. But it would be a criminal trial, potentially, unless it's thrown out. But there are significant legal obstacles that she faces. However, she does appear to be determined to go forward. The current grand jury that's investigating that - where all these witnesses are appearing, is what's called the special grand jury? It cannot issue an indictment. So, it would have to turn its evidence over, to a different grand jury that would actually vote the indictment. All of this could be quite slow. But she does seem determined, to proceed. [21:20:00] COOPER: And you heard that report, from Kara Scannell. A judge has squashed Congressman Jody Hice's attempt, to - or squash this subpoena, to appear before a grand jury. How significant is that? TOOBIN: Well, it's good for her. The more subpoenas that are quashed, the better. One of the pending requests to quash a subpoena, is from Lindsey Graham, the senator, who has been, who made a call in, to try to stop this investigation. So, every time she wins, getting someone in the grand jury? That's good. But there is a long way to go before this turns into an actual criminal case. COOPER: The Fulton County D.A. has also suggested racketeering charges. Where's racketeering in this? TOOBIN: Well, racketeering is just another term, for when you - when a prosecutor takes a bunch of disparate crimes? COOPER: Yes. TOOBIN: And combines them all, into a single - into a single one. And here, you have various - the possibility, of various attempts, to interfere with the Georgia election. Whether it's pressure on Raffensperger, the Secretary of State? Whether it's getting rid of the U.S. attorney, in Atlanta, who was - disappeared during this investigation? COOPER: Right. TOOBIN: Whether it's intimidating the court officials? If you recall, during the January 6th hearings? One woman testified, about how her life was turned upside down, by the President, attacking her. COOPER: Yes. TOOBIN: If you put all of those into one case? That could potentially be a racketeering case. COOPER: All right, Jeff Toobin, appreciate it. Thanks. TOOBIN: All right. COOPER: Coming up, just as Russia seemed ready to show the slightest bit of mercy, toward Ukraine, an attack that threatens to cut off desperately-needed food, to the world. We'll take you to Odessa, and we'll examine how Russia could be reaching its own breaking point, of Vladimir Putin's invasion. Right back. [21:25:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, tonight, is vowing to resume grain exports, despite Russia attacking the Port of Odessa, this weekend. Missile strikes came just 24 hours, after Russia agreed to allow the safe passage of grain, through the Black Sea. The U.N. and others warn of a catastrophic food crisis, without those shipments. The National Security Council's John Kirby tells CNN, the attack brings back memories of Russia carrying out strikes, on humanitarian aid, meant for Syrians. Senior International Correspondent, Ivan Watson, is part of our CNN team, on the ground, in Odessa, tonight. Joins me live. Ivan, what do we know about the state of this agreement, after the bombing? I mean, is there still a plan, in place, to export grain? IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the short answer is yes. That even though there was this attack, and this chorus of criticism that's come, of course, from the Ukrainians, but also from the U.N., and even Turkey, which helped mediate the agreement, which was signed, on Friday, in Istanbul? All of the parties are saying, ""But we still want to go ahead with this,"" including the Russians, who don't want to be seen, to be holding up the export of this precious food, out to global markets. So, it does look like they're going to try to move forward there. They've even, in fact, announced that they're working on setting up this office, in Istanbul, this Joint Coordination Center, which is supposed to help facilitate this, and ensure the safety of ships that will be going out. But there are real concerns about trust. I mean, the Port of Odessa, it's over my shoulders. And that is the port that was hit, though the Russians claim they were targeting Military infrastructure, in that port. COOPER: I mean, if this holds, how soon could ships start to move these products, out of Ukraine? WATSON: The Turks are saying, the U.N., again, these guys both helped mediate the agreement, they are saying, as soon as possible. There's still some logistical things, like setting up this coordination center, trying to clear mines that could be blocking the ports, and blocking the waterway. And there does seem to be some disagreement about whether or not there're going to be warships, escorting the cargo ships. The Russian Foreign Minister says that Russian ships will escort them. The Ukrainians are saying, ""We're not going to allow any Russian warships anywhere near our waters."" So that seems like a big detail to still try to hammer out. And just to be clear, Anderson, the Ukrainians are exporting grain through other means. They've been ramping up shipments, on the river Danube, on river barges, and river ports, there, by rail, and by truck, across borders. But they can't get anywhere near the capacity that they could, if they could load up barges, and start shipping them through the Black Sea, the way they were doing, until Russia invaded this country, last February. COOPER: You've been doing really incredible reporting, for the better part of five months, in and out of Ukraine. Can you just talk about, what it feels like, on the ground, there, now, in terms of where the war is at? WATSON: I'm struck by how much has changed, since April, when I was last here, when, I think, you were last here, or you were here a little bit later, Anderson, is that you don't see signs of the entire population, on the run. You don't see these cars with the words ""Children,"" written on the sides of them, and everybody fleeing. If anything, I think that we see, in cities, many businesses open, people going to work, people going to cafes, walking around, in parks, with their kids, it's beautiful weather, this time of year, here, in Ukraine, which either reflects that people are more comfortable, with the fact that their country is at war. Or they're confident that the Ukrainian Military will not allow Russians to break through the front lines, the way they did, at the beginning into the war, and reach their cities. And I'm talking about cities that are only 20 miles, from very active front lines-- COOPER: Yes. [21:30:00] WATSON: --where you'll see people, swimming on the beach, on the river Dnieper. So, that's pretty remarkable. Another difference is, we are seeing how the Ukrainian Military, is getting new weapons. I've seen combat units that are using refurbished captured Russian Military vehicles that even still say ""Made in Russia"" on them that they've painted Ukrainian flags on, and renovated, to use, to fight against the Russians. I've seen British Military vehicles that have just been supplied. Of course, Western shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapons. And of course, there're these U.S.-supplied HIMARS, these kinds of long-range rockets, which every Ukrainian officer, and politician, I've talked to, says, has changed the battleground, to some degree. COOPER: Yes. WATSON: Because it lets the Ukrainians strike Russian targets deep behind enemy lines. That said, there's also this ever-present fear, from these cruise missile strikes that can come anytime, anywhere, at cities, very far behind front lines-- COOPER: Yes. WATSON: --and that kill civilians and kill children. That's a threat that everybody is living with. COOPER: Yes. WATSON: And yet, they're kind of determined, to go on with life, even with that terrible threat. COOPER: Ivan Watson, in Odessa, thank you. Appreciate it. With me now, is CNN Military Analyst, and retired Army Lieutenant General, Mark Hertling. I'm wondering, what your reaction is to where the war is, what we've just heard from Ivan. Or the fact that Russia would strike Odessa, just after signing an agreement, to allow grain, to leave Odessa, just seems insane. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY EUROPE & 7TH ARMY: It's in the criminal category, Anderson, is what I would say. And what we've seen is repeated violations by Russia of various treaties. Across the board, every single time, there is an attempt to bring some type of response, from the international community? Russia has spit in the face. This time, it's of the U.N. Literally, 24 hours, after they signed the treaty that was hosted by Turkey, with Ukraine, trying to get grain, to stave off famine and starvation, they shoot missiles, at the very place that grain is coming from. So, it's just another indicator, Anderson that you just cannot trust Mr. Putin, and the way he is conducting foreign affairs, and the way he is executing this war. COOPER: What do you see, on the ground, in terms of - I mean, the war is happening. A lot of it is away from the cameras, because of the nature of where it is, the long-range artillery. What's your take, on the ebb and flow of it, right now? HERTLING: Yes. My take, Anderson, is in the East, in the Donbas region. You're talking about a slugfest that is going on, for the last three months. Ukraine has not been defeated. Russia has not been able to obtain their operational or strategic goals. They have made some tactical advances. But frankly, they have been minor, not many miles of territory gain. What you're also seeing now is President Zelenskyy has suggested, as many of us thought he would, is to open a second front. That second front is more than likely going to occur, in the Kherson Oblast, in the South. That's a critical Oblast. It's not just the city of Kherson. It is the entire province of Kherson. An area the size - about the size of the State of Maryland, the capital city of Kherson, of that particular province, has about 300,000 population on a normal day. But that area bumps up against Crimea. And it also maintains the road network, to the north, east and west. So, if President Zelenskyy gets his way, and he can generate several hundred thousand new fighting forces, to go into that area, to supplement and complement the resistance forces that have been going, against the Russians that are seemingly embedded, in that country, but are sustaining great casualties, from local resistance forces? You're going to see a second front, and it's going to cause the Russians to be put on the horns of a dilemma, about the same time that there is an inflection point, in logistics. As we said, Anderson, from the start of the second phase of the Russian war, the key element, is who is going to be able to supply the war, the best. Russia is having significant problems, unbelievable dysfunction in their logistics and their supply chains. And what you just mentioned, the Ivan, is Ukraine seems to be getting more equipment, better equipment, more efficient and effective and precise equipment, to help them counter all the Russian supplies. And that's going to be significant. COOPER: Yes. I mean, the Head of Britain's Foreign Intelligence Service, told CNN, and The Aspen Security Forum that he thinks Russia could be, quote, ""About to run out of steam,"" in Ukraine. That's what you're talking about, the logistic inflection point? [21:35:00] HERTLING: Yes. And we've been talking about that, for a couple of weeks now. COOPER: Yes. HERTLING: It is that inflection point. What is going to happen? Because this is a battle of logistics. Who gets the supplies, and who gets the effective combat power, the fastest, to counter the other forces? We have not seen Russia's forces. Even though they are a large and well-equipped, allegedly, force, they have not been able to conduct operational logistics. We're seeing Ukraine improve, across the board, in that area. They're getting counter-artillery, counter-fire forces, to the front lines, destroying the logistics that Russia has put in place, in several of these depots. And as Ivan just said, and as you mentioned, the HIMARS had been a significant factor, in that. When you're talking about just the small number of HIMARS, 16 of them that can fire about 190 effective missiles, per day, to strike targets, which the Russians cannot do? You're talking about the destruction of a lot of Russian equipment. COOPER: Yes. General Hertling, as always, I appreciate it. Thank you. Indiana has become the first state, to hold a special session, in efforts, to pass new abortion restrictions, since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Up next, we'll take a look at both sides, of the abortion battle, and what could come next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [21:40:00] COOPER: Public debate began, in Indiana, today, on a new bill that would prevent abortion, except in cases of rape, or incest, or to save the life of the mother. Lawmakers heard, from dozens, opposed to the bill, and many arguing against the new restrictions, others calling for even stricter abortion laws. This comes as Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Indianapolis, to speak with state lawmakers, today, ahead of that session. CNN's Alexandra Field has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (DEMONSTRATORS CHANT ""SAFE AND LEGAL!"") ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Thousands of demonstrators swarming Indiana State Capitol, for the heated debate, over a bill to ban abortion, at any stage of pregnancy, with exceptions for some cases of rape, incest, and threats to the life of a mother. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just judgment. FIELD (voice-over): Fierce opposition, to the bill, coming now on both sides of the issue. JODI SMITH, INDIANA RIGHT TO LIFE: Indiana Right to Life's mission is to protect the right to life. Our opposition, to this bill, is because, in its current state, it doesn't stack up to that mission. FIELD (voice-over): Some arguing that the restrictions with Indiana's bill don't go far enough. NATHANIEL MERCER, TESTIFIED INDIANA BILL DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN BANNING ABORTIONS: I'm asking the SB1 language be stripped, and a bill be replaced, with a language similar to HB 1282, which was a complete ban on abortion, with no exceptions, no compromise, no regulation. FIELD (voice-over): Others, fighting to stop another state, from denying care to women. DR. MARY OTT, PEDIATRICIAN OPPOSED TO INDIANA BILL: The proposed legislation politicizes what should be a private decision. FIELD (voice-over): Indiana, is the first state, to call a special session, to attempt to pass new laws, restricting abortion, in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. It leads the way for dozens of States, with plans to pass, similar bills. At least 12 other states have already enacted bans, or attempted to, or severely restricted abortion procedures, by going to court, for a judge's order, or by using so-called trigger laws, which were designed, to take effect, in the event of a court reversal, on Roe. (DEMONSTRATORS CHANT ""MY BODY! MY CHOICE!"") FIELD (voice-over): Indiana has become a safe haven of sorts, for women, seeking care they can't otherwise get. DR. TRACEY WILKINSON, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS, INDIANA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: We're already seeing people, traveling from other States, coming into Indiana, for abortion care, as far away as Texas, but including States like Ohio and Kentucky. So, Indiana is already trying to provide care that should be legal, and accessible, by these people, in their own States. FIELD (voice-over): Last month, a 10-year-old rape victim, traveled from Ohio, to Indianapolis, for an abortion, after her home state enacted a ban, around the sixth week of pregnancy. The Indiana University physician, who helped the child, Dr. Caitlin Bernard, drawing the ire of conservative media, some lawmakers, and the State's Attorney General. Protesting Indiana's bill, in an Op-Ed, for ""The Washington Post,"" she writes, ""People in Indiana and across the nation have called me brave. But I'm not any braver than any other physician who would do the right thing when faced with a patient in need. I don't feel brave. I feel anguished, desperate and angry."" Nearly 1,400 health care workers, from across Indiana, signing two letters, to lawmakers, voicing their objections. DR. GABRIEL BOSSLET, PULMONARY AND CRITICAL CARE PHYSICIAN: Legislating someone else's moral decisions, and religious decisions, on to everyone else that, comes directly into the clinics, is hugely problematic for us, who are trying to practice medicine. DR. CAROLINE ROUSE, MATERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN AND ABORTION CARE PROVIDER: We are concerned that this is just a harbinger of what is to come, and we are really worried about a national abortion ban. FIELD (on camera): So this, for you, goes well beyond Indiana? ROUSE: Absolutely. Indiana is first. But we are not going to be last. (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: Alexandra Field joins me now, from Indianapolis. I understand, there's a second bill, under consideration, to fund resources, for expectant mothers. FIELD: Right. Two bills that the Special Session is taking up, related to abortion. And this is a bill that would seek to allocate about $45 million, toward more resources, for expectant mothers and families. It specifically names foster and adoptive families. The bill is in line with kind of arguments that you've heard, from some conservatives, around the country that in lieu of access to abortion, States should provide greater care, for moms and babies. I spoke to a physician, here, in Indiana. She says that the funding, in the bill would be woefully inadequate, in terms of meeting the needs that this state would have. She goes on to say that these resources are important, and that they should be funded, on their merits. But she says, they are not in any way related to, or a replacement, for critically needed health care. Anderson? COOPER: Alexandra Field, thanks. Coming up next, with the NFL season, prepping to get underway, I'm going to speak with NFL Defensive End, Carl Nassib, who made history, last year, is the first act of NFL player, to announce that he was gay. Why he says it was important to do it, and the reaction, he received, across the League. We'll be right back. [21:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: So, the more than 1,600 players, in the NFL, a total of 32 teams, and for the first time, in history, last year, an active NFL player came out as gay. His name is Carl Nassib, plays the position of Defensive End, most recently, for the Las Vegas Raiders. He came out in June 2021, with a video, on Instagram. Take a look, part of it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARL NASSIB, FIRST ACTIVE NFL PLAYER TO COME OUT AS GAY: What's up, people? I'm Carl Nassib. I'm at my house here in West Chester, Pennsylvania. I just wanted to take a quick moment to say that I'm gay. I've been meaning do this for a while now. But I finally feel comfortable enough to get it off my chest. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: In a statement, after posting that video, Nassib said, he agonized over the decision, to announce he was gay, for 15 years. Said, he hopes that one day, the whole coming-out process won't be necessary. Carl Nassib is here with me now. I like how you were like, ""Yes, hey, I'm joining you from Pennsylvania, and I'm gay."" NASSIB: Yes, truly. COOPER: How much thought went into that? And how nervous were you? NASSIB: I was pretty nervous. And a good amount of thought went into it. I really wanted to do it right. And I wanted to make it not just about me, and make the biggest impact, I possibly could, with a one- minute clip. And I wanted to do it, surrounded by friends and family, in my hometown. And, yes, the response has been amazing. I mean, the amount of people that come up to me, and bringing it up, and talking about how it's impacted them, has been the most rewarding possible thing that could have happened. COOPER: I mean, I can't imagine the impact of this, on so many younger people, who grow up, playing sports, and feeling like there's not representation-- NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: --of, out there, for them. NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: This is huge. NASSIB: Yes. And that's exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to help these young kids that might be struggling with this. COOPER: That was foremost in your mind? [21:50:00] NASSIB: It was, 100 percent. And I think that we can continue this conversation. We can tell teachers, coaches, parents that they can be that one supportive adult, in these young kids' lives, to help them get by, a little bit easier, and to just spread a little more joy in their lives. COOPER: When you got to the team, when you got to the Raiders, when you were in the stadium, how was it? NASSIB: I mean, the Raiders stadium is always electric. It's a great stadium. And the fans are amazing. I've got nothing but support from my teammates, fans, coaches and everything, yes. COOPER: There was a - your coach - the coach - I'm not a football-- NASSIB: There you go (ph) Jon Gruden. COOPER: Yes, Gruden. NASSIB: Yes, yes, yes, he's right. COOPER: He resigned, after some old emails-- NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: --getting forward, and stuff. Did you ever have any issues with him? NASSIB: He was so supportive of me coming out. And then that whole thing, I tried to, take that in stride, try to focus on what was important. The team really was stronger together. And-- COOPER: But he was supportive of you? NASSIB: Absolutely, yes. COOPER: What happens now? You're a free agent. Do you want to keep playing? NASSIB: Yes, I'm keeping all options open. I'm waiting for the best opportunity. Feel like the best shape in my life. I've a lot left in the tank, working on some other projects that are really, really exciting, so. COOPER: Well that's the thing. Because you and I've talked before. NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: And I'm amazed at how focused you are, on volunteering, on giving. You gave $100,000 that was matched by the NFL to The Trevor Project-- NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: --which is great organization. NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: You also have an app that you have created. NASSIB: I do, yes. COOPER: What is it called? And what does it do? NASSIB: It's called Rayze, R-A-Y-Z-E. I first came up with the idea, four years ago, when I was volunteering, in Tampa. And I had an amazing experience, volunteering at a juvenile delinquent center. And what really struck me was, it was half a mile, from where I went to work every day. It was a half a mile, from a team full of millionaires, and a family full of billionaires, and nobody knew it was there. So, I went, a month later, got Rayze trademarked. And I was like, ""There needs to be an app out there, where somebody can go on super- easy, and find every single volunteering opportunity, in their community, in their neighborhood, on their way, to and from work."" And that's exactly what Rayze does. COOPER: That's a great idea. NASSIB: Yes, thank you. COOPER: Because you really have no sense, in any community, exactly. A lot of people want to do something, but they're not sure how to go about it. NASSIB: 100 percent. And that's that - we take all that stress, and all that complication away. Everything's about efficiency. And that's what we do. COOPER: It's interesting to me, though, that that experience of, you're playing, and you're surrounded by people, who are making a lot of money, and realizing that half a mile away-- NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: --there's kids in need. NASSIB: Absolutely. And we want to make it super-easy, for people, who can find anything that they're passionate about, right? We are onboarding so many wonderful non-profits, United Way, The Trevor Project. Across the board, we're really, doing some fun stuff. COOPER: As a kid, did you - when did you - I mean, I assume, you realized very early on that you were gay. I mean, most - I probably knew, when I was like six or seven. NASSIB: Sure. COOPER: But - whether I could put a name to it or not. But when you were playing sports, did it seem to you that there was a future as being gay and playing sports? NASSIB: I loved sports my entire life. I come from such a great sports family. And it wasn't really, in my mind, growing up. I just wanted to be the best football player, I possibly could be. And I've really had such an amazing career. I'm so lucky. And yes, I just have been met with the most support, from my family, from my friends, and teammates, throughout my career, yes. COOPER: And what - so, I don't really know how the free agent thing works. NASSIB: Yes, it's OK. COOPER: So, do you want to be in football? I mean, it seems to me, you have a lot of-- NASSIB: Yes, I'm going to become-- COOPER: --of really interesting-- NASSIB: --till I'm 65 (ph), I'm going to keep doing it. COOPER: Right. No, but I mean, you love football. But you - you're pulled in a lot of directions. I mean, you have a lot of stuff that you-- NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: --think about for the future. NASSIB: Well, and it's my passion, right? I just want it - it's been - I've been doing it since I was 8-years-old. And it's the most fun thing I can do. But I just am really excited about Rayze. I'm really excited about making an impact on and off the field, and inspiring others to do the same, yes. COOPER: And how do you - where do people go for Rayze? They just? NASSIB: Go on the App Store. We're downloadable in the App Store. You get on there. You - we have three pillars, positive social media, real volunteer matching, and simplified donations, where there's something there for everybody. If you have a really busy schedule, and you don't have time to volunteer? You got a couple kids, don't have time to volunteer? We make it super-easy to-- COOPER: Are you talking to me? NASSIB: Yes, yes, you're a busy guy! So, if you want to like - if you want to find multiple charities, multiple non-profits-- COOPER: Yes. NASSIB: --to contribute to, you can do it all super-easy, in Rayze. COOPER: Right. NASSIB: Yes. COOPER: Well, Carl Nassib, good luck to you. NASSIB: Anderson, thank you so much. COOPER: Appreciate it, thanks. NASSIB: Appreciate you. COOPER: Coming up next, Pope Francis, in Canada, with an apology, for the indigenous people there that is more than a century in the making. [21:55:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Today, Pope Francis apologized, to survivors, of what a government-commission, in 2015, in Canada, called ""Cultural genocide."" Indigenous children, who were stripped away, taken away, forcibly, from their families, stripped of their language, and their culture, often physically-, sexually-, emotionally-abused, in what were called residential schools, many of them run by the Catholic Church. The Apology took place in Canada at one such former school. I spoke to some of the survivors, several months ago, for a report, I did, for ""60 Minutes."" The one woman, I spoke with, Leona Wolf, said she was 5-years-old, when she was taken, from her family, in 1960. She says she witnessed the sexual abuse, of a cousin, by a priest, at a school, and saw what these schools did, to multiple generations, in her own family. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: Did you see the impact of this place on your mom? LEONA WOLF, CANADA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL SURVIVOR: Yes. COOPER: How? WOLF: Yes, by drinking a lot, being mean to me. And it impact us, me and my brother, and my siblings. COOPER: What was done to her, she passed on to you? WOLF: To me, yes. COOPER: And what was done to you and others here? WOLF: Was passed on to my children. This is why sometimes I go into my rage of anger, and I cry, because it all, it was all done to us, all of us. But it's going to stop now, you know? It is. COOPER: You believe that? WOLF: Yes, I'm going to, I'm breaking the cycle with my great- grandchildren. (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: And the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, based in Ottawa, says it welcomes the Pope's apology, called for concrete actions, to help educate about the history of these schools. That's it for us. The news continues. Want to turn it over to Don, and ""DON LEMON TONIGHT."" Don?

ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST;  Oren, thank you very much from The Pentagon tonight.   Earlier in our program, our guest Marc Short referred to some allegations against Congressman Matt Gaetz. We should note Matt Gaetz has not been charged, let alone convicted.   Thanks for joining us.   AC 360 starts now.   [20:00:25]   ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Good evening.   We begin tonight with major new developments where the January 6 hearings left off.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  We have much work yet to do and we will see you all in September.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  Well, one thing became clear today, nobody is waiting until September. For starters, we learned tonight that Marc Short, former Vice President Pence's Chief of Staff testified under subpoena last week before a Federal grand jury in Washington. That's according to a source familiar with the matter.   Now, this is significant because Short was there in the room for some of the key moments on and around the 6th. He is also the highest profile witness known to have testified so far and we'll talk more about what that might say about the Justice Department's Criminal Investigation and how far it can go.   Also late today, President Biden weighed in on the central figure in Thursday's January 6 hearings.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So what happened? The Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police, other law enforcement agencies were attacked and assaulted before our very eyes, speared, sprayed, stomped on, brutalized, and lives were lost.   And for three hours, the defeated former President of the United States watched it all happen as he sat in the comfort of the private dining room next to the Oval Office.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  As for the Committee, it apparently is not waiting for September either.   Today a member, Virginia Democratic Congresswoman Elaine Luria released a new video clip. It shows the former President's unwillingness to include in his speech on January 7th language holding the mob that he invited, incited, and wanted to join accountable.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   QUESTION:  Do you recognize what this is?   IVANKA TRUMP, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISER:  It looks like a copy of a draft of the remarks for that day.   QUESTION:  And as you can see throughout the document, there are lines crossed out. There are some -- there are some words added in. do you recognize the handwriting?   I. TRUMP:  It looks like my father's handwriting.   PAT CIPOLLONE, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL:  In my view, he needed to express very clearly that the people who commit violent acts, went into the Capitol, did what they did, should be prosecuted and should be arrested.   QUESTION:  It looks like here that he crossed out that he was directing the Department of Justice to ensure all law breakers are prosecuted to the full extent of the law, we must send a clear message not with mercy, but with justice. Legal consequences must be swift and firm. Do you know why he wanted that crossed out?   JARED KUSHNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISER:  I don't know.   CIPOLLONE:  And that needed to be stated. They did not represent him or his political views in any form or fashion.   QUESTION:  He also has crossed out, I want to be very clear, you do not represent me. You do not represent our movement. Do you remember -- do you know why he crossed that language out of the statement?   KUSHNER:  I don't know.  (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  Those were the words that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump claiming not to know why those words were crossed out. The simplest possibility, of course, is that the President, the former President crossed it out, because he did not agree with it and didn't want to say it and knew the implications if he did say it on his supporters.   At Thursday's hearing, you'll recall the Select Committee showed video of the former President refusing to read another line, one saying the election was over, because he didn't believe that it was and still doesn't to this day.   We can hear more along those lines tomorrow when he returns to Washington for the first time since leaving office. He'll be giving the keynote speech at a think tank staffed by former administration members.   As for what's next for the Select Committee, one priority is those missing Secret Service text messages from and around January 6th. Here is Committee member, Zoe Lofgren today.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Well, I don't know, but here is the fact. I mean, on January 16th, Secret Service, we received a letter signed by four Committee Chairmen, this is before the J6 Committee existed, telling them to preserve all the evidence. Eleven days later, they erased it. So that's problematic.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  Congresswoman Lofgren also endorsed these remarks by Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney over the weekend about possibly compelling testimony from Ginni Thomas, the right-wing activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.   [20:05:08]   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Is your Committee planning on talking to Ginni Thomas even though her lawyer has expressed a reluctance to cooperate?   CHENEY:  We are. The Committee is engaged with her counsel. We certainly hope that she will agree to come in voluntarily, but the Committee is fully prepared to contemplate a subpoena if she does not.  I hope it doesn't get to that. I hope she will come in voluntarily.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  Ginni Thomas, you will remember repeatedly corresponded with then White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, and Trump's lawyer, John Eastman, who was pushing what became the former President's scheme to overturn the election.   So talking to her with all that could entail lies ahead for the Committee and possibly the Courts as well.   Also ahead, what might come from the criminal grand jury in Georgia probing the former President's alleged election meddling there? Some new developments to tell you about on that tonight, so we've got new reporting as well on the dark cloud hanging over it all. The fact that a recent polling, 70 percent of Republicans now believe some variation of this dangerous theme you're about to hear.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Trump has told lies about the election in the US. He said he didn't really lose. Do you think that all the lies about the election are damaging for American democracy?   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you believe he lied?   O'SULLIVAN:  Do you not?   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No. I do not. He won.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  So some breaking news, ""The New York Times"" and ""Wall Street Journal"" are now reporting to Greg Jacob, former General Counsel to the former Vice President also appeared last week before the grand jury. That's from CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, talking to those two people, and we'll have more from his report ahead in this hour.   First, let's go to CNN's Ryan Nobles at the Capitol.   So Ryan, what more can you tell us about both Jacob and Marc Short's testimony before the grand jury?   RYAN NOBLES, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Anderson, it clearly means that the Department of Justice investigation into the election meddling by Donald Trump and his associates is expanding in a big way.   Both Marc Short and Greg Jacob are two key players. When they began their cooperation with the January 6 Elect Committee, it opened the door into the whole line of pressure that was put on Vice President Mike Pence during that period of time. It provided an insight into the push to have Pence stand in the way of the certification of the election results on January 6th.   The efforts to get him to accept a false slate of electors. There are so many different connections that Pence's office has to the attempts to stand in the way of the election being certified for Joe Biden, and the fact that Jacob and Marc Short who are both very cooperative with the Committee and told them a lot about what they knew during that period of time, it also would indicate that they would show the same level of cooperation with the Department of Justice as well.  So this is absolutely significant. It shows just how serious the  Department of Justice is taking things as their investigation speeds up in a major way.   COOPER:  Do we know why Congresswoman Luria released this video clip today, instead of including it in the hearing last week?   NOBLES:  We do, it's basically because the Committee just has so much evidence, and they just do not have enough time to pack them all into these public hearings. You know, more than 17 million people watched on Thursday night, but the hearing only lasted about two and a half hours.   I'm told that as they plan these hearings, one of their first dress rehearsals, the initial hearing could have run as long as four hours because they had so much content and evidence that they believed was necessary to share with the American people.   As a result, they still have a lot that didn't make it into the hearings that they will release at different points. Adam Kinzinger released a kind of a preview to the hearing on that day. None of that content was actually in the hearing itself. We saw this from Congressman Luria today. There is a good chance that we're going to see more examples of this in the days ahead, particularly in the month of August, where the Committee plans to do most of its work behind closed doors.   We should expect them to release this type of content and evidence as they lead into these next round of hearings, which will take place in September.   COOPER:  Ryan Nobles, appreciate it. Thanks.   For more on Marc Short, the Federal grand jury and what it could all mean, we're joined by CNN chief legal analyst and former Federal prosecutor, Jeffrey Toobin.   So, Greg Jacob, Marc Short testifying in front of a Federal grand jury. How significant?   JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST:  it's a big deal, especially in the big picture. I mean, remember the main criticism of the Justice Department so far has been that they are unduly focused or even exclusively focused on the small fish, the people who were inside the Capitol, you know, who trespassed, who committed acts of violence, and not focused at all on the people who may have committed the larger offenses, the people closest to Trump.   This shows that they are looking at what was going on at the White House. Plus, the Pence officials are part of or witnesses to it at least three of the most important areas of inquiry. One is the pressure on Mike Pence to violate his oath and stop the certification of the election.   [20:10:10]  The fake electors' scheme, and the effort to corrupt the Justice  Department. They know about all of that. So, the fact that the Justice Department now has those people in the grand jury suggest that's what they are investigating.   COOPER:  This is a dumb question, but the Justice Department, do they need to re-interview before a grand jury everybody who testified before the January 6 Committee or the main players?   TOOBIN:  Well, I mean --   COOPER:  They won't just take the testimony that was given under oath by Marc Short, obviously to the January 6 Committee.   TOOBIN:  They could and they could just use that testimony in the grand jury. The issue with the grand jury is, at some point, presumably they're going to be asked to issue indictments of someone. They have to have evidence on which to base those indictments.   You know, hearsay evidence is admissible in a grand jury, so they could go play the videos of the depositions from the January 6 Committee, but prosecutors usually want to see witnesses for themselves. They may not ask exactly the same questions as those congressional investigators.   COOPER:  Would they have had to subpoena Marc Short?   TOOBIN:  He said --   COOPER:  That they did.   TOOBIN:  Earlier today that they did, yes.   COOPER:  What does it say that they were willing to subpoena, someone who is formerly high levels, Marc Short?   TOOBIN:  It shows they're serious. I mean, this is -- I mean, that's why today is so important. I mean, this grand jury testimony is so important, because it shows the Justice Department is not just focusing on the small fish.   Now whether there will be indictments of people up to and including President Trump, I certainly don't know that. But there certainly wouldn't be indictments of the people like Trump, if these people were not in the grand jury.   COOPER:  Because you know, Merrick Garland is saying, you know, no person is above the law. I mean, I guess you could look at this and say that puts this into kind of sharper focus.   TOOBIN:  Well, and you know, grand jury's investigations are by definition secret. The only reason this came out is that reporters happened to just see Short coming out of the Courthouse. We don't know who exactly have testified in the grand jury. But you know, this -- the fact that they are there is a big deal.  COOPER:  So, we don't know and won't know until either someone breaks  it or charges are filed, how far advanced they are in their investigation.   TOOBIN:  No, I mean, there are several ways you can find out. I mean, you can see people, physically see them going in and out. Every -- all the reporters know which are the grand jury rooms, individuals can say that they testified, but you know, whether the grand jury issues an indictment or not, that is almost never known until --   COOPER:  And if there is, you know, this investigation that continues and there is a new President, and that President appoints a new head of the Department of Justice, does the investigation automatically continue?   TOOBIN:  It certainly does not automatically continue. It can continue. I mean, the customer in the Justice Department, especially with career people, is that investigations continue from one administration to the next.   But certainly, the senior leadership will change and I think, you know, if Donald Trump is elected President in 2024, the odds of this investigation continuing in any form like that, I would say is remote at best.   COOPER:  Yes, Jeff Toobin, appreciate it. Thanks.   Perspective now on this and the bigger picture, for that we're joined by ""New York Times"" columnist Thomas Friedman, author of a virtual library of bestsellers, including the classic ""From Beirut to Jerusalem.""   Tom, the last time we spoke was right after Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony. You said, ""The truth is of no value if we cannot act on the truth."" Does Marc Short and Greg Jacob testifying before a Federal grand jury make you believe that the truth may be acted upon?   THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"": Yes, you know, Anderson. If you just watch every day now, you see not only very senior former administration officials stepping out and testifying, but I would also point to something very important.   I think the editorial in ""The Wall Street Journal"" and ""The New York Post,"" Rupert Murdoch's two flagship newspapers saying that Donald Trump was unworthy of being President. Again, I think that's very important.   I think that -- and they cited the January 6 Committee. That's a direct connection between saying this truth that has been revealed by this Committee leads to this action this man is unworthy of ever being President again, I think that's very important.   COOPER:  It is so interesting that that has occurred because, I mean, you could intellectually make the argument, well look, a lot of the information that we saw of the timeline of what the President did on that day, it was more or less known, but there was something about the sheer weight of hearing after hearing, well-organized in which we, the country is confronted -- so those who watched -- they are confronted day after day or evening session after session with the granular horror of what occurred on that day and in the run up to it.   [20:15:14]   FRIEDMAN:  Yes. I think that's what it is. It's been the drip, drip, drip of truth, and for which we can -- we have to thank every day, Liz Cheney for having the courage to step out and make this, albeit in a small way, a bipartisan committee. And there's just something about her relentless approach to this and her unblinking willingness to put the truth out there, and it obviously is affecting a lot of principled and moderate Republicans, which I think are readers of ""The Wall Street Journal,"" traditional business Republicans or whatnot.   And you just take 10 to 15 percent of the party who they represent and you basically tell them, and they act on that Trump is unworthy to be President, and the party has a real problem.   And also, you see people acting on the truth, Anderson and that Vice President Pence, basically every speech he gives is a critique of his former boss and partner. So DeSantis -- they're all sort of stepping out here. I don't know when the dam is going to burst, if it's going to burst.   But one day, one of them, not a Mitt Romney or Liz Cheney, but one of them in the center is going to step out and say, ""Donald, it's time for you to step aside.""   COOPER:  We're going to hear later in the program from the former -- some of the former President's supporters who still believe the lies that the election was stolen despite all the evidence to the contrary. Our Donie O'Sullivan has that unenviable task of asking these questions time and again.   Can any of that be changed? I mean, is that malleable? Can that be changed? Or do you think it's just too baked in?   FRIEDMAN:  Well, I think I've always felt that a lot of the people who supported Trump didn't really care that much about Trump. He hated the people that hate Trump, more than they actually are focused on Trump. And I think we do have to ask that so deep now into his career and public affairs in our country, how is it that a significant number of people, despite all of the evidence, still see Donald Trump as a brick they want to throw through a window?   Why do they feel that way? What is that window? What is that brick? I think as reporters, we do have to keep asking that question, and not just dismiss this.   At the same time, I take succor, Anderson, in the fact that people like ""The Wall Street Journal"" and ""The New York Post"" are basically saying, ""No, that's the truth,"" and the truth compels action and the action is that this man is unworthy to be President.   COOPER:  And yet, so many Republicans in the Senate, in the House are claiming they're not even watching the hearings. I saw Tim Scott saying he wasn't watching the hearings. I mean, I think he said that on FOX News.   The idea, I mean, maybe they are not, but the idea that they are not, they don't care enough to watch or just want that as an excuse that they can distance themselves. I mean, these are significant hearings.   FRIEDMAN:  Oh, A, I doubt that they are not watching, but I'll tell you one thing, Anderson, they read ""The Wall Street Journal,"" and they read ""The New York Post,"" and they know where their bread is buttered from. They know which media they need in order to be re-elected, and I guarantee you, a lot of them today in the in the quiet of their conversations are saying, ""Did you see that editorial by Rupert?""   COOPER:  As Rupert goes, so goes, the rest of the Republican Party?   FRIEDMAN:  Well, I think that, you know, Rupert Murdoch's media has been so much the house organ of the Republican Party. We know, when you watch, you know, some of the senators, how frightened they are, if they're criticized by anyone on FOX, let alone in ""The New York Post"" or ""The Wall Street Journal.""   I think it was a very important break in the dam, and it just takes 10 or 15 percent, and suddenly a mandate to declare unworthy of being President will not be able to be President.   COOPER:  Tom Friedman, appreciate it as always. Thank you.   FRIEDMAN:  You bet.   COOPER:  Coming up next, more on the possibility of issuing a subpoena to the wife of a sitting Supreme Court Justice and just why the Select Committee is so interested in what she may know.   Also, the latest from the fire lines in California, unbelievable images as well as what it's like right now in the hottest place on earth in the middle of a global heatwave.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   [20:23:29]   COOPER:  We told you at the top about the House Select Committee's interest in hearing from Ginni Thomas, even if it means issuing her a subpoena to testify. She is the wife of the Supreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas, but as our Randi Kaye reports, she is neither an ordinary Washington spouse nor a mere bystander in the attempt to overturn the 2020 election.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)   GINNY THOMAS, WIFE OF CHIEF JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS:  Clarence Thomas, you're the best man walking the face of the earth.   RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has some explaining to do, like what about those emails she exchanged with conservative Attorney John Eastman, who the House January 6 Committee says helped devise a scheme to try and overturn Joe Biden's victory.   It's unclear what Ginni Thomas, a well-known conservative activist said to Eastman in the e-mails or if she will appear before the Committee to try to explain any of it.   The Committee is also investigating more than two dozen text messages Ginni Thomas sent just days after Biden's victory to Mark Meadows, who was Donald Trump's Chief of Staff.   G. THOMAS:  The second Reagan revolution is growing.   KAYE (voice over):  In one text from November of 2020, Ginni Thomas wrote to Meadows, ""Help this great President stand firm, Mark. The majority knows Biden and the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history.""   In another, she seemed to embrace a long held false QAnon conspiracy theory that Trump had watermarked mail-in ballots so he could track potential fraud.   She wrote to Meadows, ""Watermarked ballots in over 12 states have been part of a huge Trump and military white hat sting operation in 12 key battleground states."" And Ginni Thomas also stood by lawyer Sidney Powell who spread the long debunked conspiracy theory that electronic voting machines had somehow switched ballots from Trump to Biden.   [20:25:11]   She wrote to Meadows, ""Sounds like Sidney and her team are getting inundated with evidence of fraud. Make a plan. Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down.""   At one point, ""The Washington Post"" reports Ginni Thomas urged Meadows to watch a YouTube video about the power of never conceding.   REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  If she has relevant information or investigation, we hope she comes involuntarily.   KAYE (voice over):  In an interview this year with the conservative website, ""The Free Beacon,"" Ginni Thomas said she briefly attended the January 6th rally at the Capitol, but returned home before the insurrection.   A lawyer for Thomas said in a letter to the House Select Committee last month that he does not believe there is currently a sufficient basis to speak with her.   CLARENCE THOMAS, US SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE CHIEF JUSTICE:  My wife is totally my best friend.   KAYE (voice over):  According to Clarence Thomas' 2004 biography, Ginni Thomas was born Virginia Lamp and raised in Omaha, Nebraska. Her father reportedly was an engineer, and her mother was an outspoken Republican activist who played a prominent role in her daughter's life.   According to ""The New York Times,"" she joined her high school's Republican Club in 1974. Later at Creighton University in Omaha, she earned a Law Degree.   In March, a video circulated on Twitter showing Thomas speaking at a 1986 Cult Awareness Network event in Missouri. On this decade's old video, she shares her experience of leaving Lifespring, a controversial group founded in 1974 that was long considered a cult.   G. THOMAS:  When you come away from a cult, you have to find a balance in your life as far as getting involved with fighting the cult or exposing it, and kind of the other angle is getting a sense of yourself and what was it that made you get into that group?   KAYE (voice over):  She reportedly met Clarence Thomas in 1986 at a conference on affirmative action, they married in 1987.   C. THOMAS:  I keep a sign on my desk, ""Don't make fun of your wife's choices. You were one of them.""   (END VIDEOTAPE)   COOPER:  I mean, clearly, the January 6 Committee has a lot to ask her about. Has Ginni Thomas tried to explain herself in any way because she seemed to have bought into some of the craziest --   KAYE:  Yes.   COOPER:  QAnon and other fantasies out there.   KAYE:  Yes, it certainly sounds that way. She has, Anderson, tried to set the record straight on how much she shares with her husband, who as we know is the Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.   In March, she spoke to ""The Washington Free Beacon"" and she said to them -- she told them, ""Like so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles, and aspirations for America, but we have our own separate careers."" She said, ""Our own ideas and opinions, too. Clarence doesn't discuss his work with me and I don't involve him in my work."" That's what she said.   She also went on to say that she had no role in helping those who were planning the January 6th events and she said that the violence that she saw at the Capitol she called it, ""disgusting"" and she was disappointed.   COOPER:  I'm stunned though that she is texting Mark Meadows, talking about releasing the Kraken and white hat military operations. I mean, this is stuff you get off the internet. That's just --   KAYE:  And that's why the Committee might want to talk to her because they have these text messages and e-mails apparently, and they want to know more.   COOPER:  Randi Kaye, fascinating. Thanks so much.  KAYE:  Sure.   COOPER:  Ahead, the biggest test yet of the former President's power over the Republican Party and the truth since he left office, Donie O'Sullivan shows us how the reality of the election on January 6th are dividing the GOP in Arizona, that's next.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   [20:32:17] COOPER: A week from tomorrow, Arizona Republican voters decide who they want on the ballot for the governor's race this fall. It is a race so bitterly divided that the former president and former vice president went there Friday holding dueling events for two of the GOP candidates. The 45th President unsurprisingly is backing the 2020 election denier. But an Arizona state that put Joe Biden over the top, Republicans may have to consider if they accept the reality of the last presidential vote in January 6, before going to vote this time around. Our Donie O'Sullivan went to Arizona, we got a sense of the divide firsthand. We warn you some of the language -- the language you'll hear may be offensive. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WANDA SCHOENBERNER, TRUMP SUPPORTER FROM SOUTH DAKOTA: He didn't lose. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Sensitive. SCHOENBERNER: He just didn't lose. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Do you believe the election was stolen. REX MCCRACKER, TRUMP SUPPORTER: Yes. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Do you have faith in elections now? MCCRACKER: No. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Do you believe the 2020 election was stolen? CURTIS NEILSON, REPUBLICAN VOTER: No, I don't believe the 2020 election was stolen. I believe that there are aspects of the 2020 election that were unfair. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): In Arizona, a Republican Party at odds with itself, Trump and Pence holding competing events with two very different understandings of reality. DONALD TRUMP (R) FMR PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: We need a landslide so big that the radical left cannot rig it or steal it, even if they try. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): At Trump's rally a bonfire of conspiracy theories. (on-camera): Have you ever watched on January 6 hearings? SCHOENBERNER: I have. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): What you think? SCHOENBERNER: I think they're a bunch of bullshit. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Why? SCHOENBERNER: Well, because you have both sides. Were you getting one side of the story? O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): You mean like the side that attacked the Capitol? SCHOENBERNER: You really believe that happened? O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): I was there. SCHOENBERNER: OK. I have a lot of people that were there too. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): And? SCHOENBERNER: And saw things that it wasn't what they say it was. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): But there's been hundreds of Trump supporters now charged. (INAUDIBLE) pled guilty. SCHOENBERNER: So do you think it's right for those people to have those people in jail and not getting me justice in our American system? Are you kidding? O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Do you think it was right that they attacked the Capitol? SCHOENBERNER: I know they didn't. That was an inside job, buddy. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): The vast conspiracy theory that those who stormed the Capitol were not Trump supporters is widespread here. (on-camera): Have you guys been watching the January 6 hearings at all? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, we saw it when it all went down. And then we saw like a lot of the BLM and Antifa people in the building as well. And it's just, it's just nonsense at all. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): But I think like 800 people now have been charged, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): (INAUDIBLE) are Black Lives Matter or Antifa. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, that doesn't matter --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're not charging. [20:35:00] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That doesn't mean --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. They have not been brought into court or their due process because they have not been arrested. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hunter Biden hasn't been arrested. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Trump has told lies about the election and that, he said he didn't really lose. Do you think that all the lies about the election are damaging for American democracy? MARDI MINX, TRUMP SUPPORTER: You believe you lied. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Do you not? MINX: No, I do not. I don't. He won. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): But these are no longer fringe ideas. A majority of Republicans do not believe Biden legitimately won the election. (on-camera): Hey, guys, any of you want to talk to us? (voice-over): The Proud Boys who Trump once infamously told to stand back and stand by, now a regular fixture outside his events. (on-camera): Any Proud Boys want to talk to us today? No? You're watching January 6 hearings? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, (INAUDIBLE). UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're (INAUDIBLE) CNN, right? O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): CNN, yes. (CROSSTALK) O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): My friends. OK. Thanks, guys. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): The former president here to campaign for a ticket of conspiracy theory spouting candidates who say they would have overturned results of the 2020 election in Arizona, like Kari Lake candidate for governor. KARI LAKE (R-AZ) GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I know for a fact we will no longer accept rigged elections. Who's with me on that? O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): Pence here campaigning for Lake's Republican rival. MIKE PENCE (R) FMR VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: Arizona needs Karrin Taylor Robson in the state house. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): Here, we met some Republicans who are done with Trump. MITCH COMPTON, REPUBLICAN PENCE SUPPORTER: I voted for Trump twice. If Mike Pence runs, I'm voting for Mike Pence. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): OK. So why is that? COMPTON: I just think that, you know, everyone seemed the January 6 Committee. He stood up for democracy that day, you know, he's like, I'm not leaving the Capitol because I need to be here. And he was the one that was making phone calls to the military and trying to fix the situation while Trump was crying in the dining room. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): But even among this crowd, there is sympathy for Trump's election lies and support for a 2024 run. (on-camera): You're about to see Pence speak here. Trump's not a big fan of him right now, JULIE FISHER, TRUMP SUPPORTER: I understand that. I hear that he could have not certified those results, pending all the claims of the fraud. And I wish he would have done that. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): Pence had no legal basis to do that. Also, among those here, Rusty Bowers, a lifelong Republican and speaker of the Arizona State House. (on-camera): We're talking to a lot of people in here today who said they're not even, they're not watching the January 6 hearings, they still believe lies about the 2020 election. How do you -- what would be your message to them? RUSTY BOWERS (R-AZ) HOUSE SPEAKER: I have no message for him. I can't help him. You don't want to look, you don't want to see, then you won't see. But I've seen enough to know. And I know that other people right in this room have done their best to count everything and do it all right. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): He testified before the January 6 committee about Trump's efforts to get him to overturn the 2020 results in his state. (on-camera): What is these conspiracy theories, these lies about the election about democracy. What is that doing to trust in this state? BOWERS: It destroys it. It destroys it. We've got to let things go. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): What would need to change for you to have faith in U.S. democracy? MCCRACKEN: I don't trust our government, first of all, period. And if you don't have fair elections, well, good, are they? O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Do you ever worry that you're wrong? Do you ever worry that --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, absolutely. O'SULLIVAN (on-camera): Never worry that maybe Trump has sold you a lie. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. If you start researching and believe that you're the one who's wrong, and that you're crazy, which I did do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, maybe I'm wrong. And maybe I am being brainwashed and believing something that someone's telling me, but then you go in and look the other direction and you find lies after lies after lies. COMPTON: It doesn't matter if it was stolen or not. If the Republicans want to take back the House and take back the Senate, and then eventually, the White House, they need to move on. (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: I got to say the fact that those two did doubt, occasionally, they said that they were wrong, maybe wrong. That's, I mean, I think it's a good healthy exercise for us all to go through all the time. Like, what if I'm wrong? O'SULLIVAN: Yes. The issue, of course, is that when you go online and do your own research, as many folks do, is there is just such a vast array of BS, right? And there's so many very convincing, there's a lot of money, of course, but behind disinformation campaigns to convince people that American democracy is (INAUDIBLE). COOPER: Right. But just the logic, though, I mean, as you pointed out, well, there's 800 people who have been, you know, charged and none of them that there is no, I mean, the guy was saying, like, we saw all these BLM and Antifa people. They didn't they weren't there. I mean --  O'SULLIVAN: Yes. COOPER: -- it just. O'SULLIVAN: And, you know, when why I brought up the indictments was because that's it on paper, right. And then, so when I say well, why is no Antifa or BLM? In their mind, it's not because Antifa and BLM are not there, it's because it's because the Deep State has decided we're not going to prosecute Antifa and BLM. So it's a very dark rabbit hole (INAUDIBLE). [20:40:00] COOPER: Even the Pence rally you were finding people --  O'SULLIVAN: Yes. COOPER: -- who bought into the lies? O'SULLIVAN: Yes, and that's what was I mean both these events were on the same day, went to the Pence rally in the morning and that Pence event. Pence was there to endorse a candidate who is more pro democracy, I guess, and she hasn't quite said that she wanted to overturn the results. But the point being Pence was there to say, you know, we believe in our democracy, even at that events, there were some Trump supporters who, you know, went along with the Pence country right and Trump won but we're saying we don't have (INAUDIBLE) --  COOPER: The so-called Proud Boys do they -- are they up late at night on the phone discussing what shirts that they're going to wear? O'SULLIVAN: I think there's a lot of coordination going on. COOPER: Yes. O'SULLIVAN: Yes. I almost blend it in there in my black but. COOPER: Now when you were wearing Fred Perry. O'SULLIVAN: I can't afford it. COOPER: Yes, well, the Proud Boys, you know. Donie, thank you. Appreciate what you do. Coming up, California's wildfire fight the fury of the flames near Yosemite being called unprecedented. Plus, Gary Tuchman visits the hottest place on Earth, which is right here in the U.S. for some it's a way of life for others, risky adventure. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Three thousand Californians are out of their homes tonight a massive wildfire burning just outside Yosemite National Park is in its fourth night. The smoke be seen from space it's that bad. A state fire official says the oak fire showing unprecedented behavior moving incredibly fast. There's another view from an infrared camera the one Each area at the top of your screen shows the flames that battalion chief says the fire severity is the direct result of the climate crisis. California severe drought means little comfort in the hottest place on earth Death Valley, that includes a small town in the middle of the desert. [20:45:15] Tonight, Gary Tuchman takes us there to see what life is like in the middle of this summer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If 125 degrees made a sound, this might be it. This Siberian Husky far away from the land of were ancient Siberian ancestors, living in furnace Creek, California, the largest community in the majestic Death Valley National Park, which is considered the hottest place on Earth. Carolina Martucci and Edoardo Campi are tourists from Italy. CAROLINA MARTUCCI, TOURIST VISITING DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK: I think it's one of a kind place in the entire world. TUCHMAN (on-camera): What do you think of the heat? EDOARDO CAMPI, TOURIST VISITING DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK: It's a lot, but I think that if you get your precautions, it can be sustainable. TUCHMAN (voice-over): Dee Beauchamp has lived and worked here for 15 years, and knows how to keep it sustainable. DEE BEAUCHAMP, DEATH VALLEY RESIDENT: We've got water, has some Gatorade or the shade when you need to. And take your time, always do a good job. Don't rush it. TUCHMAN (voice-over): Dee is mowing the lawn in the blazing sun at a large resort called the Oasis at Death Valley. She's the lead gardener who moved here from Michigan. I love the things I do, the people I work with and the job that I do. TUCHMAN (voice-over): Mike Schuber is a nature photographer who also guards. MIKE SCHUBER, DEATH VALLEY RESIDENT: With the heats you don't realize like you may be losing a lot of fluids. You might be thinking fatigue, heat exhaustion might set in, so just kind of want to like I have a schedule like on my alarm. So it's like it forces me to take a break. Like I'll start going off my -- in fact, whoever you're talking to was just going off. I was like, oh, it's time to confer --  TUCHMAN (on-camera): Well sorry to interrupt you (INAUDIBLE) --  SCHUBER: No, you're good. You're good. Yes. TUCHMAN (voice-over): He also has one other tip. SCHUBER: Just got to love the heat. TUCHMAN (voice-over): And lots of people do. The resort is full while we are here. JOHN KUKREJA, GENERAL MANAGER, THE OASIS AT DEATH VALLEY RESORT: What inspires you is you're looking at this place and you say wait a minute, this is a jewel in the middle of nowhere. TUCHMAN (voice-over): In fact, for most of the year this jewel has very comfortable temperatures. But the summer heat is definitely intense now. Almost all outdoor workers start early. So they're done before the mercury finishes its climb. Outdoor activities are busiest very early too like golf. And what you're seeing here. (on-camera): There are lots of trails here in Death Valley hiking is extremely popular. Even during this month, July the hottest month of the year. Everywhere you go. You see signs and warnings take plenty of water with you when you hike and don't hike after 10:00 a.m. Right now the day is still young, it is still morning. And the temperature is 111 degrees. (voice-over): Relatively moderate compared to the 120 plus, which is only a few hours away which leads to the outdoors becoming rather desolate, and indoor Death Valley coming alive. Like at the ice cream parlor. (on-camera): Here in Death Valley in July, working here, is it the best job or is it the best job? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's definitely the best job. TUCHMAN (voice-over): But Dee Beauchamp think she also has the best job, does she ever even consider moving back north? BEAUCHAMP: Not the cold, I don't want to be in the cold. TUCHMAN (on-camera): You're happy with this? BEAUCHAMP: I'm happy. This is perfect. TUCHMAN (voice-over): Shortly after 8:00 p.m. the sun sets, the temperature goes down to the low 90s overnight before another scorcher today. (END VIDEOTAPE) TUCHMAN: Anderson there's no such thing as a cool summer in Death Valley. And that's precisely why so many tourists want to come here in the summer and experience the intense heat for themselves that's on their bucket list. That being said, it's nice to see that the tourists here for the most part seem to be paying attention to the residents here, seem to be respecting Mother Nature. We don't see any biking, we don't see any jogging, just a lot of slow and deliberate walking and a lot of water bottles. Anderson. COOPER: Gary Tuchman, thanks so much. Up next, new details on the investigation into the Robb Elementary shooting after the school principals placed -- was placed on leave with pay. And the latest from a school board meeting happening right now where parents demand more be done to protect their children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I asked you to put yourself in my shoes, in our shoes as a parent, you have talked about hiring security, and I feel that no amount of security will ease our hearts and our minds. We saw so many cops and all we needed was Army to be there. And nothing happened. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:53:15] COOPER: With just weeks until Uvalde the students are set to return to school, parents at a school board meeting that's happening right now are expressing their concerns with law enforcement and the lack of answers about the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School two months ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The rest of the police department that are still on payroll, I don't see how you could expect the families to have the same trust, the lack thereof. They'll drop off the kids at school and the same guys that filled them and ladies are the same people that are supposed to protect them. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: That's comes as Uvalde county commissioners voted unanimously to conduct an independent investigation into the Valley County Sheriff's response today. With me now CNN crime and justice correspondent, Shimon Prokupecz. So what is the latest from the school board meeting? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME & JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Right. So look, I think one of the things that is very clear, there's this disconnect, there's no trust between the school board, the parents, and still it just seems you know, I've been to several of these school board meetings and watching tonight. There's just this lack of empathy, it seems in this misunderstanding, they just cannot connect with the community. So much so that the community today, you know, they weren't even supposed to have this meeting. So to have it in a small room, then the parents put pressure on them to have it in this auditorium. And then they had all these police officers there, and the parents were just reacting just in this way this angry way. Why would you have all these officers here? Take a listen to some of that reaction, Anderson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And who, whose job was it to call all of these fine officers in? Because I see more officers here than have ever looked over at our schools. What are y'all worried about? Our kids are dead, we only worried about. (END VIDEO CLIP) PROKUPECZ: And this is a thing Anderson, every meeting that we -- I've been through they've had all these officers there and the problem in that community right now is that they don't trust any police officers, not the local police officers, not the state troopers and certainly not the school police officers. They want all of them gone. So this school board has a lot of work still (INAUDIBLE). [20:55:15] COOPER: What about the decision on the School District Police Chief Arredondo? PROKUPECZ: That's still in limbo, they were going to vote on that. And then something happened. And now his lawyer is kind of fighting it, it appears that there's some kind of a fight going on. He's not going to win that fight in the end. But the school says we need to do this due process. And this is the law, and this is the way we need to do things. COOPER: And Mandy Gutierrez was the school principal, the time of the shooting has been placed on administrative leave? PROKUPECZ: Yes, she's on administrative leave. And part of that is probably because of when this report came back from the Texas legislators, they listed all of these problems at the school between the locks, and the lack of security and the issues that the teachers were having with the doors. And so, I guess now the school is taking action against her. And so we're seeing slowly, slowly, some of the people who are responsible that day for taking action (INAUDIBLE). COOPER: It seems like a lot is behind closed doors, and they're not communicating. PROKUPECZ: They're not. COOPER: And --  PROKUPECZ: It's troubling. And, you know, we're two months into this, and the parents are still so angry, and trying to heal and they're still saying, we don't have all the answers. COOPER: It's crazy. I mean, it's unbelievable the way these parents (INAUDIBLE) --  PROKUPECZ: Sad, it's horrific, and it's just so painful. COOPER: Yes. Shimon Prokupecz, thank you as always. Coming up, we'll look at how the January 6 hearings impacted the nation's view the former president, and the impact could have in the midterms as well as the 2024 presidential race.

And everybody, you don't want to miss Ed's special report: ""Deep in the Pockets of Texas."" It is Sunday night at eight. Thanks so much for joining us. AC 360 starts now. [20:00:26] JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: From medieval to defenseless to guilty as charged. Steve Bannon is next stop for defying the house January 6 Committee could be Federal prison. John Berman here in for Anderson. Far from carrying out his pretrial threat to go medieval on the prosecution, Steve Bannon did not even put on a defense in his contempt of Congress trial, and it did not take long for a jury to convict the former President's one-time chief strategist and insurrection rabble rouser on both counts. Now, the man who could not stop talking about overturning the election to his listeners but refused to talk about his role when lawfully subpoenaed, he awaits sentencing. CNN's Katelyn Polantz was in the Courtroom and joins us now. Katelyn, walk us through what happened in Court today and how Bannon reacted when the verdict was read. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, John, when Steve Bannon moved around the Courthouse today on the grounds in the Courtroom, he appeared to be very much himself. He was smiling throughout the day, right before the verdict came down, when the jury came back in, he was waiting on his phone what appeared to be looking at social media, thanking his lawyers, patting them on the back. But then when the jury came in to deliver their verdict, they came in about two and a half hours after they started. When they came in, Steve Bannon didn't show a lot of emotion. He smirked a little bit. He nodded as the Judge thanked the jury, but ultimately, he wasn't really that reactive in Court, and the jury had bought what the prosecution was arguing, that this was like a parking ticket that Steve Bannon needed to have paid when he got this subpoena from the House Committee. He got the subpoena, he should have turned over documents or showed up for testimony. He did not he did not have the proper excuses. That said, Steve Bannon then exited the Court and here's what he said on the steps of the Courthouse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE BANNON, HOST, ""WAR ROOM"": We may have lost the battle here today, but we're not going to lose this war. In the closing argument, the prosecutor missed one very important phrase, right? I stand with Trump and the Constitution, and I will never back off that ever. (END VIDEO CLIP) POLANTZ: Now, those words that ""I stand with Donald Trump,"" those words that ""I stand with Donald Trump,"" that's actually a piece of evidence that came into this trial that the prosecution presented that he had been saying that when he was refusing to comply with this subpoena -- John. BERMAN: So what is the January 6 Committee now saying about this conviction? POLANTZ: Well, John, this really is a conviction that underlines the power of Congress, their ability to issue a subpoena, and that there will be consequences if someone does not respond to a subpoena. So the House Select Committees Chair and Vice Chair Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney. They sent out a statement today, it said: ""The conviction of Steve Bannon is a victory for the rule of law and an important affirmation of the Select Committee's work, anyone who obstructs our investigation should face consequences. No one is above the law."" But what they're saying there is about the consequences. It is not about the enforcement of the subpoena, and they are left with this conviction that is great news for them, but it doesn't mean that they're going to be getting information out of Steve Bannon now enforcing that subpoena, they will not and may not ever learn what Steve Bannon knew about the lead up to January 6th, and about his conversations with President Trump. BERMAN: Katelyn, what's the timeline for sentencing and how fast can an appeal be filed? POLANTZ: Right. Well, we don't have -- we don't have a long time ahead of us. Steve Bannon now is going to be -- his sentencing is set for October 21st, so that's about one year exactly from whenever he was supposed to sit for this testimony for Congress. His attorney did tell us that they are going to appeal. We are watching for that now. It hasn't been filed. But he's saying it is a bullet proof appeal. We're going to have to wait and see whether that is indeed the case. Other people have challenged this successfully decades ago in the McCarthy era, contempt of Congress cases. We just don't know what that will look like now as it progresses through the court with Steve Bannon -- John. BERMAN: Katelyn Polantz who was in the Courtroom, thank you so much for sharing your reporting. Perspective now from CNN senior investigative correspondent, Drew Griffin whose CNN's Special Report ""Steve Bannon: Divided We Fall"" airs right after us tonight. Also, CNN chief legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, Jeffrey Toobin. Jeffrey, what's your reaction to the verdict? Is this what you expected? JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Berman, this was not a cliffhanger. I mean, there's a reason why the government put on its case with just two witnesses and in about half a day, there was no issue here. I mean, he got a subpoena for testimony and documents. He didn't take the fifth, he didn't negotiate, he just didn't show up. [20:05:10] TOOBIN: And it is actually a very important case, because if somehow Bannon had won, people would have been free to just ignore congressional subpoenas, and this is a vindication, I think the Committee was right, of the rule of law. BERMAN: This matters for congressional committees now, and going forward, both Democratic led and Republican. TOOBIN: You couldn't have a system where people can just blow a subpoena. BERMAN: So Drew, you reported on Bannon extensively for your CNN Special Report. Well, what do you make of Bannon's comments outside of Court today and the fact that he was smirking as the guilty verdicts were read? DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think two things were very telling. One, he stands for Trump and the Constitution, which after the January 6 Hearing of last night, we know are somewhat mutually exclusive. The other thing that he said was pertinent was, he may have lost his battle, but not the war, and I think when people are celebrating this conviction, you have to keep in mind Bannon is in this for the long game. He was in it before Trump, he will be in it after Trump. And I imagine he will use this conviction to make himself a martyr among his followers, to raise funds among his followers, and continue that long game, which is to battle the current progressive movement by injecting a kind of cancerous poison within the United States in trying to rat out this country from the inside out. So I do believe Bannon thinks he is in a war. I do believe this conviction was important for the January 6 Committee and for the rule of law, but again, I say don't celebrate too loudly because Bannon is in this for a very long, long viewpoint. BERMAN: You know, Jeffrey, Katelyn and Drew just referring to this right now, a victory for the January 6 Committee. How much of a victory is it if they don't get Bannon and in front of them, which they won't necessarily do? TOOBIN: They won't. I mean, it's a victory in terms of the principle, in terms of evidence gathering. It's not really a victory, because Bannon is going to continue to defy the Committee. He has now paid a price for it, but it is quite clear, he's not going to testify. And I think this just underlines how difficult the Committee's job has been, because he's not the only one who has defied the Committee and look how many months it took just to get to this state. I mean, at least nine months to get a conviction for a Committee that is running out of time, as I say the principle is important, but they're not going to get any evidence there. BERMAN: So you know, Drew, how do you think all this will be viewed within the Trump orb, because Steve Bannon, he didn't testify. He stood outside the Courthouse each day listing his political grievances, but it's a far cry from going medieval, which he said he would do. GRIFFIN: Right, or be able to get up on a witness stand and spew his wrath or to even just stand outside the Courtroom and try to defend Trump or put his arm around Trump. Two things I didn't see, I didn't see Bannon fighting back, you know, vehemently on the street. I didn't see any of Trump or Trump's people coming to his aid either. So, it was very telling to me the distance that still remains at least publicly between these two entities -- Trump World and Steve Bannon -- even though we do believe that there is some sort of level of communication or wink and nod communication, should Trump run again, I'm sure Bannon will be behind it. But it is telling to me that there is public distance between Trump and Bannon at this point. BERMAN: I mean, Jeffrey, what about the claim of a bulletproof appeal from Bannon's counsel who is basing that on the idea that Bannon was doing this or defy the subpoena on advice of counsel, and that wasn't allowed to be submitted? Is that something that can be appealed? TOOBIN: No, I don't think so. I think that, you know, it's just more bluster, more performance art from Bannon that has no -- it has no legal basis. You know, he was well-advised by counsel, and counsel can't tell you to break the law, and it is quite obvious that he broke the law. If he had simply taken the Fifth or even had his lawyer write a letter saying Bannon was going to take the Fifth, none of this would have happened because you're allowed to take the Fifth. He simply defied the Committee, and that's just not allowed. BERMAN: You know, Drew, it is minimum 30-day sentence for sentencing. Do you think he cares about serving 30 days in jail? GRIFFIN: Oh, I think 30 days in jail is 30 days in jail, no matter who you are. So, I do think he cares about that. I think he'll, you know, kick and scream his way trying to stay out of that. But yes, I mean, 30 days in the slammer. I mean, you can ask Jeffrey his 30 days in the slammer. TOOBIN: No one wants to go and it does -- and 30 days is the minimum. I mean, it could be up to two years. I don't think it's going to be two years, but you know, people don't like to go to prison. Actually, it would likely be jail for a sentence this long. BERMAN: Jeffrey Toobin, Drew Griffin, thanks to both of you and again you can catch Drew's special report, which is terrific. ""Steve Bannon: Divided we Fall"" immediately after AC 360, nine o'clock Eastern Time right here on CNN. [20:10:15] BERMAN: So next, new reporting on the missing Secret Service text messages from January 6. Also last night, Select Committee hearing including testimony that agents guarding Mike Pence were worried about a deadly confrontation with the mob. That and everything else much of it no less horrifying about what the former President was doing with the seat of democracy under attack. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BERMAN: New developments tonight of the missing Secret Service text messages from January 6th reporting this shows just for openers that there were indeed more sent than just the one single exchange the agency gave the January 6 Committee. CNN's Whitney Wild joins us now and Whitney, what have you learned? WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, two sources tell CNN that up to 24 Secret Service agents whose text messages were requested by the Inspector General last year, 10 had metadata to show that text messages were exchanged around the 5th and the 6th of January 2021, but the content was lost due to a data migration that started three weeks after January 6th. [20:15:14] WILD: Investigators at the Secret Service found that another 10 of those phones had no text messages at all, three of them had only personal text messages. And one John, as we've previously reported several times, one person did save a text message exchange. BERMAN: What are they doing to determine if the phones have relevant information? WILD: Well, according to a letter that they sent to the House Select Committee after the House Select Committee asked the Secret Service in a subpoena to produce these records to make a vigorous effort to try to find any text messages that might have been missing. They conducted a rigorous probe and again, according to that letter, that included forensic examinations, speaking with some of the identified individuals to try to figure out perhaps what the content of these text messages were, but also to try to figure out if it's possible that some of these text messages were stored in locations that hadn't already been searched by the Secret Service. However, John, those efforts have ground to a halt because as CNN first reported, Thursday, Wednesday night, the DHS Inspector General told the Secret Service to stop its investigation, because they are concerned, those efforts could interfere with an ongoing criminal probe by the Inspector General -- John. BERMAN: All right, Whitney Wild, thank you so much for that and these missing messages take on new urgency given what the Select Committee revealed last night about the danger to Mike Pence's detail from a mob the former President first incited with a speech then enraged with a tweet and sure, what they were up against was far worse than anyone could have possibly imagined until last night, because last night, for the first time, we heard Secret Service radio transmissions as agents tried to secure an escape route for the former Vice President, his family, and staff. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) UNKNOWN: Hold, they've entered the building. Hold. UNKNOWN: Harden that door up. UNKNOWN: If we're moving, we need to move now. UNKNOWN: Copy. UNKNOWN: If we lose any more time, we may have -- we may lose the ability to leave. So, if we're going to leave, we need to do it now. UNKNOWN: They've gained access to the second floor. And I've got public about five feet from me down here below. UNKNOWN: Okay, copy. They are on the second floor. Moving in now. We may want to consider getting out and leaving now. Copy? UNKNOWN: Will we encounter the people, once we make our way? UNKNOWN: Repeat? UNKNOWN: ...encounter any individuals if we made our way to the (bleep). UNKNOWN: There's six officers between us and the people that are five to 10 feet away from me. UNKNOWN: Stand by, I am going down to evaluate. UNKNOWN: Go ahead. UNKNOWN: We have a clear shot if we move quickly. We've got smoke downstairs. Standby. Unknown smoke downstairs. UNKNOWN: By the protestors? UNKNOWN: Is that route compromised? UNKNOWN: We have the (bleep) is secure. However, we will bypass some protestors that are being contained. There is smoke. Unknown, what kind of smoke it is. Copy? UNKNOWN: Clear. We're coming out now. All right, make a way. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: So did any of the deleted Secret Service text messages that day discuss any of this? We don't know. What we did learn from testimony last night though, was chilling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN: The members of the VP detail at this time were starting to fear for their own lives. There were a lot of -- there was a lot of yelling, a lot of very personal calls over the radio, so it was disturbing. I don't like talking about it, but there were calls to say goodbye to family members, so on and so forth. It was getting -- for whatever the reason was on the ground, the VP detail thought that this was about to get very ugly. UNKNOWN: And did you hear that over the radio? UNKNOWN: Correct. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: So we'll talk more about this shortly with a former Secret Service agent. The danger of course was amplified by the former President's tweet that Mike Pence didn't have the courage his words to help overturn the election. Here is former Deputy White House Press Secretary, Sarah Matthews, who resigned later that day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ELAINE LURIA (D-VA): Miss Matthews, what was your reaction to the President's tweet about Vice President Pence? SARAH MATTHEWS, FORMER DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: So it was obvious that the situation at the Capitol was violent and escalating quickly. And so, I thought that the tweet about the Vice President was the last thing that was needed in that moment. And I remember thinking that this was going to be bad for him to tweet this because it was essentially him giving the greenlight to these people telling them that what they were doing at the steps of the Capitol and entering the Capitol was okay, that they were justified in their anger. And he shouldn't have been doing that, he should have been telling these people to go home and to leave and to condemn the violence that we were seeing. (END VIDEO CLIP) [20:20:10] BERMAN: Which he, of course, did not. In fact, according to testimony last night for administration insiders for more than three hours, he did nothing at all to stop the assault. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So are you aware of any phone call by the President of the United States to the Secretary of Defense that day? PAT CIPOLLONE, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: Not that I am aware of, no. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you aware of any phone call by the President of United States to the Attorney General of the United States that day? CIPOLLONE: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you aware of any phone call by the President of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security that day? CIPOLLONE: I'm not aware of that, no. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you ever hear the Vice President or excuse me, the President ask for the National Guard? LT. GEN. KEITH KELLOGG (RET), U.S. ARMY: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you ever hear the President ask for law enforcement response? KELLOGG: No. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: Again, according to the testimony, all from insiders, former supporters, Republicans, other than his inflammatory tweet, he did nothing but watch as aides, advisers, family members, and besieged Republican lawmakers begged him to call off the mob. The Committee also showed testimony about his resistance to making the video telling them to go home, and his inability shown in outtakes from his taped message the next day to give up on his election lie. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whenever you're ready, sir. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack yesterday. And to those who broke the law, you will pay. You do not represent our movement. You do not represent our country. And if you broke the law, -- I can't say that. I'm not going to -- I already said ""You will pay."" The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defied the seat of -- It's defiled. Right? See, I can't see it very well. Okay, I'll do this. I'm going to do this. Let's go. But this election is now over. Congress has certified the results. I don't want to say the election is over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results without saying the election is over, okay. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: A position he maintains to this day. The Committee also presented video evidence to Republican Senator Josh Hawley's eagerness to egg on protesters that day, with his now famous clenched fists which reportedly riled up the mob, later showing his eagerness to get the hell out of dodge as fast as he could scamper and flee the very people he was once happy to incite. The video played to laughter in the gallery, but there was little comic relief, after all we heard last night in the other installments and what we could learn when the hearings begin again in September. With us now, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, also CNN contributor former Watergate hearing witness and Nixon White House Counsel, John Dean, and CNN's Abby Phillip, anchor of CNN ""Inside Politics Sunday."" Andy, I want to start with you. We heard from former White House staffers that as the Capitol is being attacked, the former President didn't call the National Guard, didn't call the Secretary of Defense, didn't call the FBI, didn't call the Department of Homeland Security, and didn't call the Capitol Police. Does that make the case to you, as the Committee laid out that he deliberately chose not to act? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: It's really, really important, John. I can't overstress this. Like I think that presentation they put on last night is really the keystone to connecting this story they have laid out over the course of the hearings. So we've heard right through all the previous hearings, all the attempts that the President made, the President and his people made to obstruct the certification of the election, to overturn the results of the election, to get in the way of this day of certification, and having failed in every other respect, from his lawsuits to the request to cease voting machines to pressure on DOJ, pressure on State officials, everything else they've done. He knew on that night of December 19th when he sent that infamous text, it was in his hands. The only thing he had left to do was to summon a mob to come to DC on the 6th to try to physically stop them from certifying the results. So seeing -- hearing this testimony last night and realizing that the President sat there and did absolutely nothing while the attack was going on, it really shed a light on really two things. Number one, he did nothing because that's what he wanted to happen. He called those people to DC for that purpose. They were executing his plan, his idea, so why would he stop it? And secondly, it was absolutely an affirmative of choice. It wasn't just laziness or a lack of attention or not a failure to understand what the Constitution required him to do in that crucial moment. [20:25:10] MCCABE: It was a decision to let a violent mob continue to attack the Capitol on the off chance that it might satisfy his desire to stay in power. BERMAN: So John Dean, does that strengthen a potential criminal case against the former President and perhaps increase the likelihood that the Justice Department will go in that direction? JOHN DEAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It depends upon the case they seek to make. The case, I think they should make is seditious conspiracy. The case, I think they have made and it is pretty clear, and this added to it is conspiracy to defraud the United States 18 USC 371, which happens to be the statute that got most of the people in Watergate, including a draft indictment against Nixon. So they've made that case, they've also made obstruction of Congress. I think they have a case, but I don't think they have the right case yet, which, as I say, is seditious conspiracy, which is a very serious crime, but this was a very serious event. BERMAN: Abby, I want to play again, the outtake from the former President, what he said on January 7th. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: But this election is now over. Congress has certified the results. I don't want to say the election is over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results without saying the election is over, okay? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But Congress has certified -- now, Congress -- TRUMP: Yes, right. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now, Congress -- TRUMP: I didn't say over. So let me see. Go to the paragraph before. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: You know, Abby, what's the impact of him not wanting to say the election was over on January 7th, when we know in the last few weeks, he is still calling officials asking them to overturn election results in places. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, I think that that's exactly the point is that, his position on this on January 7th is basically what it is today, despite the mountain of evidence that has come out proving that all of his claims are essentially false. That is, you know, Trump in a nutshell, he never wants to concede, and will say false things over and over again, despite all evidence to the contrary, in some ways to reinforce that he -- just his own belief in his mind is sufficient. That's obviously not going to cut it for the January 6 Committee, but I think the question is, at what point do Republicans see all of this evidence and say, ""Enough is enough?"" I mean, I remember watching that video when they actually released it and there were all kinds of cuts that were made to the video because it took so long to get him just to put out this milquetoast, you know, statement, more than 24 hours after a really horrific tragedy had unfolded in the Capitol. It says everything that you need to know about how reluctant Trump was even then to acknowledge what happened and his role in that. BERMAN: You know, our White House team reported, it took an hour to make this three-minute video. But even when we screw up on TV, that's not good timing, an hour to make three minutes. Not good. PHILLIP: Exactly. BERMAN: Andy, the Secret Service text messages, the 10 Secret Service personnel that had phones that contain metadata, but not the actual text messages, what does that tell you? Will we ever see that? And just the significance of the fact that there's now apparently a criminal investigation of sorts into this? MCCABE: Well, I mean, the criminal investigation is very serious and it is going to have the effect unfortunately, of further confusing this issue, because you now you have the original OIG investigation that was looking at the Secret Service over their performance on January 6th, you have the January 6 Committee that was asking for the same information for their purposes and now you have this criminal investigation. So very confusing lay down there. But, you know, let's go back to the comments that the Secret Service made last week when this controversy really came to light. What they said was in no uncertain terms, they said no text messages were lost, and that seemed preposterous at the time, and now we know, of course, that was false. We have 10 phones on which the metadata proves there were text messages, and the content is gone. And so we have no idea what those messages are. This is just a confounding level of -- in the least case, organizational irresponsibility. The Secret Service is an agency of Federal law enforcement officials. First and foremost, their obligation is to the rule of law. They have responsibilities to preserve their records. Those records could be relevant in criminal prosecutions of all different sorts. Those records have to be turned over in discovery of criminal defendants, and now we know that own systems and processes aren't sufficient to even meet those sorts of responsibilities. [20:30:12] And of course, they should go to whatever lengths are necessary to try to recover the messages that we now know we currently can't, can't grab. BERMAN: Vice Chair Liz Cheney, Abby, very prominent last night. She's got a primary a tough primary. Were right now it looks like it may be hard for her to win in August. What do you think, is next for her if she loses? ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Liz Cheney has been really clear, she's making a case against Donald Trump. This is about preventing Trump himself from ever being in that White House again. And so, she has basically put her own political career, at least in Wyoming on the line for that. The question now is where does she take it beyond Wyoming? How far does she take it? And I think that there are a lot of possibilities here. There is a desire in some corners of the Republican Party to find an escape hatch from Trump. Liz Cheney is helping them find that escape hatch, and what role she will play then in this, you know, new era if there is one is I think hers to decide. I mean, she is the most prominent Republican doing this kind of thing. No other Republican of her stature is doing what she's doing. And I think for that reason alone, you know, it just means that I think her stature in whatever post Trump future there is for that party is going to be hers to decide she's going to be writing the playbook for that. BERMAN: Abby Phillip, John Dean, Andrew McCabe, thank you all so much on this Friday night. Next, a former secret service agents take on how much closer Mike Pence is detail came than we knew just a day ago to what could have been a kill or be killed moment at the Capitol. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:36:41] BERMAN: Before the break, you heard some of the testimony played last night from a national security official identity concealed about radio transmission from Mike Pence a security detail. This is another portion of it no less disturbing to the first. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was just chaos, they were just yelling. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Obviously, you've conveyed that's disturbing. But what, what prompted you to put it into an entry as it states there, Service at the Capitol --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If they're running out of options and they're getting nervous. It sounds like that we came very close to either Service having to use lethal options or worse. At that point I don't know. Is the VP compromised? Is the detail -- like I don't know, like, we didn't have visibility but it doesn't -- if they're screaming and saying things like say goodbye to the family, like, the floor needs to know this is going to a whole another level soon. (END AUDIO CLIP) BERMAN: Thankfully, it did not but only we now know by the slimmest of margins. Here to talk about it a former secret service agent, CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow. Jonathan, great to see you. A whole another level here when you hear that testimony, just how close the Vice President was to that danger on January 6, and their agents, you heard them doing their best to avoid a bad outcome. In your experience, what would they have been navigating in those moments? JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, John, good evening. I just want to say one thing through this radio transmission in the corresponding video, the public is really getting a first hand account have really never seen before actions of the Secret Service during a dynamic moment, and I think when I heard the transmissions last night, and I listened to them time and time again, to me, the communication was really clear and concise, right? There's no doubt that this was a tense situation. But this is what the Secret Service actually trains for. And, you know, they rose to the moment in a rapidly deteriorating operating environment, they actually provided clear and concise information, they communicated with each other, and did exactly what they're supposed to do in their moment. Their training, their tactics, and their experience took over to protect not only the Vice President, but the Vice President's staff and the Vice President's family who were all there at the moment. So, I actually want to push back on the anonymous source last night, you know, I didn't see a level of panic. What I saw was agents actually systematically doing their job like I have trained for, like they have trained for. And, you know, this is the moment that all of that training comes to fruition in you engage the exact same way that they did. BERMAN: I can't remember ever hearing transmissions like that, about an event that we all saw. It's just not something that ends up in the public record like that. You mentioned, this anonymous White House security official was how the committee identified that person who said in that testimony, the agents were starting to, quote, fear for their own lives, and they were making calls to say goodbye to family members. How did that strike you? WACKROW: I, quite frankly, John, just speaking candidly, I find it nonsensical. That is not the way the Secret Service trains. When you're -- to the point where you're assigned to the Vice President's detail or the President's detail, you are trained to operate under immense pressure, you're saying that you are going to take pause and, you know, call your family that's different -- that's definitely not what the ethos of the Secret Service's their mission driven, every single woman demand officer and agent is focused on the protection of that individual, in this case, the Vice President. Again, I don't know who the source was, I'm sure it was somebody who was in the White House Situation Room who was listening to radio transmissions without context. What I saw and what I heard were things that we have trained on time and time again, with Secret Service agents trained for our three big things, tactical, medical and relocation situations. And in this case, we actually got two of them. We got the tactical and the relocation. One, the operating environment was deteriorating. So the security plan for that had to quickly be enacted. Now, that environment was destabilizing very quickly. We have to relocate the protectee. All of this stuff isn't ad hoc. This stuff is planned. It's trained on time and time again and that's why those women and men were on that detail on the day because they are the best at what they do. [20:40:07] BERMAN: Jonathan Wackrow, thank you for understanding this because again, it's just not something that we've had an opportunity to hear not anything like it before. Appreciate it. WACKROW: Great. Thanks. BERMAN: Coming up, how President Biden is responding to his COVID treatment and the prognosis his doctor gave for him today. We'll have a live report from the White House, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BERMAN: More than a day since the White House announced President Biden has COVID, his doctor says the President's symptoms, quote, have improved. The comments came in a letter released to the public. The President is isolating but still meeting virtually with staff. At the end of one meeting with his economic team today, reporters asked the president how he was doing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sir, how do you feel? Are you feeling better? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you guys. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: So thumbs up, according to the President. I'm joined by CNN White House correspondent MJ Lee. MJ, what's the latest tonight on how the President is doing? MJ LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well. John, the White House is essentially saying that the President continues to feel fine that his symptoms remain mild. That is according to both the letter from his doctor that you mentioned and also the briefing that we got today for the second day in a row from both the White House press secretary and the White House COVID coordinator. According to this letter, that was released earlier today from his doctor at the highest point his temperature yesterday was 99.4 degrees that's not even a fever he did take Tylenol and his temperature remained in the normal range. We know that he is still feeling some fatigue, he still has a runny nose. His cough, which was dry yesterday, is now a loose cough. That's pretty typical in the course of these things. His voice sounds a little deeper. And I think we actually saw that in the video that you showed before, when we heard a little bit of the President, actually speaking as he met with some of his aides, virtually, of course. [20:45:34] Now, one notable thing that we learned today is that he has been using his inhaler a couple of times, according to Dr. Jha, who briefed reporters, since he tested positive for COVID. You might know that the President did have asthma as a child. Dr. Jha was emphatic that this isn't something that he actually uses with any regularity. The last time that he used it was actually last fall when he had a cold. So again, the big picture message from the White House today is that the President continues to feel fine, and the symptoms are really manageable and mild. BERMAN: So MJ, we have heard from Dr. Jha, who's the White House COVID coordinator, and we have had regular updates from them. But we haven't heard directly from the President's physician. He hasn't spoken to the press. Why? What's the White House saying about that? LEE: That's right. You're talking about Dr. Kevin O'Connor. This is the President's physician who has been monitoring the President including in person, and virtually as well. But you're right. But the person that has been briefing reporters, the last few days has been Dr. Jha, though it's important to note that he has been in contact with the President as well. Now, what they are essentially saying is that they think that they are giving all the information that is necessary to the press, particularly given that his symptoms, according to the White House remain mild. But I do think that we saw at the White House press briefing today, there were some questions that probably could have been better answered by Dr. O'Connor. Things like his vitals, details about his oxygen levels. That's not information that the White House has provided. And also just the question of so why was it that President Biden felt like he needed to use his inhaler? So again, these are more details that you would presume the White House president's physician rather could answer better than Dr. Jha, but for the time being, they said that they have no plans for him to directly address reporters. BERMAN: MJ Lee, appreciate the update, keep us posted. Still to come, the Vice President and the former president holding -- the former vice president I should say, and the former president holding dueling events in Arizona today, just one day after millions witnessed the evidence presented by the January 6 committee showing just how each man reacted or didn't when the nation was under attack. We have a live report from Arizona, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:51:56] BERMAN: A full on proxy war between the former president and his vice president was on display today with both men holding dueling events in the key swing state of Arizona. The split between the two former running mates also on display during last night's hearing over the 2020 election and it all has implications for 2024 as well. Kristen Holmes has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A duel in the desert as Donald Trump and Mike Pence square off once again. DONALD TRUMP (R) FMR PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: I just wanted to tell you that you have a great, great fighter. MIKE PENCE (R) FMR VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: I'm here because Arizona and America need Karrin Taylor Robson as the next governor of Arizona. HOLMES (voice-over): This time in a GOP primary for Arizona governor that's become a test of the former president's election lies versus Republicans calling to move on from 2020. Trump rallying with his endorsed candidate Kari Lake, Friday. TRUMP: Kari Lake, I tell you she is incredible. HOLMES (voice-over): A former local TV news anchor who builds a campaign around conspiracy theories and denials that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've called Joe Biden an illegitimate president. Was that mean? KARI LAKE (R-AZ) GOVERNOR CANDIDATE: He lost the election and he shouldn't be in the White House. We had a corrupt election. I'd actually like to ask everybody on the stage if they would agree we had a corrupt stolen election. Raise your hand. Did we have -- did we have this --  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would like to. I'm not going to play your --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've got questions. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- your stunt. HOLMES (voice-over): Rankling some state Republicans. GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R-AZ): Kari Lake's misleading voters with no evidence. I also think this election should be about the future. I don't think we should think for one more moment about 2020 --  HOLMES (voice-over): Including term limited Governor Doug Ducey who's once friendly relationship with the former President has long since soured over Ducey's refusal to overturn Arizona's 2020 election results. TRUMP: And I know Kari is going to be involved, what an improvement. Quite an improvement she's going to be over your current governor. He's a disaster. HOLMES (voice-over): Ducey joined the former vice president crisscrossing the state Friday in support of Karrin Taylor Robson, former member of the Arizona Board Of Regents. KARRIN TAYLOR ROBSON (R-AZ) GOVERNOR CANDIDATE: Kari Lake discovered God guns in the GOP about five minutes before she decided to run for governor. Arizona cannot, cannot allow a fraud in the governor's office. HOLMES (voice-over): Some Arizona voters tell CNN they aren't ready to move on from the 2020 election, or Pence's role. DEBBIE KELLY, ARIZONA VOTER: He chickened out on the country is what I believe. HOLMES (voice-over): While others hope to put it in the past. JESS YESCALIS, ARIZONA VOTER: It impacted me in 2020, but we're in 2022. And we've got to look to the future, not the past. HOLMES (voice-over): This is the second gubernatorial primary in which Pence and Trump have been at odds. The first time was in Georgia, When Pence back Brian Kemp defeated Trump endorsed David Perdue. PENCE: When you say yes to Governor Brian Kemp tomorrow, you will send a deafening message all across America that the Republican Party is the party of the future. HOLMES (voice-over): As Pence and Trump appear on a collision course in 2024. (END VIDEOTAPE) [20:55:01] BERMAN: All right, Kristen Holmes joins us now live from Prescott Valley, Arizona. So Kristen, early voting has begun there. How were the candidates looking who were actually on the ballot in that state? HOLMES: Well, right now Trump endorsed Kari Lake is considered the front runner, but in recent weeks, we have seen Robson really starting to close that gap. Now earlier today at that Pence-Robson event, we spoke to a number of undecided voters. And it was interesting, John, several of them told us that they were planning their final decision around where these candidates actually stood on the 2020 election, one woman telling you that she was there to hear more from Robson because she was concerned that Robeson didn't care enough about what happened in 2020, another man telling me that he was leaning towards Robson over Lake because he was tired of talking about that 2020 election. So you can see here how deep the divide is within the Republican Party, particularly here in Arizona, John. BERMAN: Right, Kristen Holmes, thank you very much. Next, just in, Uvalde's district attorney makes a bold statement about possibly indicting police officers in connection with the Robb Elementary tragedy. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BERMAN: This just in the Uvalde district attorney has just told CNN that once she receives the Texas Rangers investigation into the slow response to the Robb Elementary School shooting, she would not hesitate to indict anyone including police officers, if the law allowed it and it is appropriate. [21:00:00] Meanwhile, we have all the school board has canceled tomorrow's meeting to consider whether to fire School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo, the district superintendent says they are doing so in part at the request of his attorney. They will meet at a later date with Arredondo still on unpaid administrative leave. The CNN Special Report ""STEVE BANNON, DIVIDED WE FALL,"" starts right now.

The National Snow and Ice Data Center telling CNN that they are expecting another major melt event later on this week, and they actually expect that one to extend to much more of the ice sheet.   And Erin, you know, we've seen it in Europe, in many parts of the US there and even here in Greenland, these heatwaves, and we expect to see a lot more of those as the global climate continues to rise -- Erin.   ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST:  All right, Rene, thank you very much.   And then of course you see that giant deluge and how does it feed through the whole world.   Thank you so much. And thanks to all of you for joining us. AC 360 starts now.   [20:00:44]   ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, ANDERSON COOPER 360:  Good evening.   With the House January 6 Committee gearing up for its primetime finale tomorrow, we begin tonight with a headline that makes it as good a case as any for the Committee's existence and certainly underscores a threat to democracy that's not gone away.   Now, at first, you might think it's a typo, but it's not. ""Wisconsin assembly speaker says Trump called him this month to decertify 2020 election."" That's the headline.   Now the story comes in the wake of a State Court ruling on ballot drop boxes in future elections, not the last one quotes Wisconsin's Assembly Speaker, a Republican is saying that the former President called him last week trying to overturn his 2020 defeat.  Last week, as the Speaker put it, ""I explained it is not allowed under  the Constitution, adding, ""He has a different opinion."" In other words, Trump may be sweating and stewing in Mar-a-Lago, but he is still at it.   And there were other warning signs today as well. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers -- remember him -- lifelong Republican who refused to buckle to pressure from the former President and who testified emotionally before the Select Committee?   Well, we learned he was just censured by the State Party, which declared him no longer a Republican in good standing.   In Maryland last night, primary voters chose Dan Cox, a proponent of the 2020 election lie to be the Republican nominee for Governor. Now, he once called on the former President to seize voting machines. He also sponsored buses to take people to the so-called Stop the Steal rally on January 6th, and that afternoon, he tweeted Mike Pence is a traitor. So there's that.   There is also this we got today having to do with a former White House aide named, Garrett Ziegler. According to ""The New York Times,"" he escorted Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell into the White House for that unhinge meeting on December 18th. Zeigler met with the Select Committee earlier this week and said this afterwards about the members on Telegram.   (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)   GARRETT ZIEGLER, FORMER TRUMP AIDE:  They're Bolsheviks, so they probably do hate the American founders and most White people in general. This is a Bolshevistic anti-White campaign. If you can't see that, your eyes are freaking closed.   And so they see me as a young Christian who they can try to basically scare, right.   (END AUDIO CLIP)   COOPER:  That guy was an aide to the President. This went on for 27 minutes, during which Ziegler used vulgar and misogynistic language to attack two other witnesses, Cassidy Hutchinson and Alyssa Farah Griffin.   As for the missing Secret Service text messages from the 6th. Well, today we learned that of the messages sent or received by 24 individuals, the agency has only managed to provide the Select Committee with one single exchange. Committee leadership in a statement late today said they have concerns.   So if all that falls under what you might call the debit side of the balance sheet, there are also new items on the other side. A New York Judge today ordering Rudy Giuliani to appear before the Georgia grand jury probing election interference there. A bipartisan group of senators today reaching agreement on legislation beefing up the Electoral Count Act, which if passed would make it harder to do what the former President did in 2020.   And Attorney General Garland today gave the strongest signal yet that when it comes to bringing criminal charges in connection with what the former President did, no one is immune from prosecution.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  No person is above the law in this country. I can't say it any more clearly than that. There is nothing in the principles of prosecution and any other factors which prevent us from investigating anyone -- anyone -- who is criminally responsible for attempting to undo a democratic election.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  As for the Committee's business tomorrow, the final hearing expected to focus on what the former President did and more importantly, probably did not do for three hours and seven minutes as the mob he invited then incited, ransacked the Capitol.   Expected to testify, former Deputy White House Press Secretary, Sarah Matthews and former Deputy National Security Adviser, Matthew Pottinger. Here are some of what they have already told the Committee in video testimony about what they saw during that time.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   SARAH MATTHEWS, FORMER DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We had all talked about at that point about how it was bad and, you know, the situation was getting out of hand.   I think when Kayleigh gave us that order of don't say anything to the media, I told her that I thought the President needed to tweet something.   [20:05:08]   MATTHEW POTTINGER, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  One of my staff brought me a printout of a tweet by the President.   MATTHEWS:  We all got a notification. So, we knew it was a tweet from the President, and we looked down and it was a tweet about Mike Pence.  POTTINGER:  And the tweet, said something to the effect that Mike Pence, the Vice President didn't have the courage to do what he -- what should have been done.   MATTHEWS:  I remember us saying that that was the last thing that needed to be tweeted at that moment. The situation was already bad. And so it felt like he was pouring gasoline on the fire by tweeting that.   POTTINGER:  I read that tweet, and made a decision at that moment to resign. That's where I knew that I was leaving that day.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  COOPER:  Again, tonight, it's a lot.   Joining us now is Maryland Democratic Congressman and House Select Committee member, Jamie Raskin.   So congressman, what more should we expect to learn, you think, from these witnesses who are testifying tomorrow, Pottinger and Matthews?   REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Well, generally, we're going to see what Donald Trump was doing and what he was not doing during that 187- minute fateful period of American history.   He continued to exhort and inflame and incite the crowd. He continued to direct, extremely negative comments towards Vice President Pence and he didn't have the courage to do what needed to be done. He obviously inflamed the crowd in the morning saying, ""You've got to fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore."" He directed them to the Capitol, and so on.   And those two witnesses, both have very individual specific stories to tell, and I think I'll keep everybody in suspense until tomorrow for that.   COOPER:  ""The Washington Post"" is just up with some reporting within really the past few minutes that the Committee is planning to show outtakes from remarks the former President delivered January 7th, can you tell us any more about that?   RASKIN:  Well, the President displayed extreme difficulty in completing his remarks, of course, you know, hours had passed when he could have simply taken a walk for 10 or 15 seconds over to address the country and address his followers and tell them to go home, and people were beseeching him, begging him to do that and he refused to do that.   So then he finally went over and made some comments at the end of the day, when it was clear that no thanks to the President, our police forces had turned the tide and were beginning to, you know, win back the Capitol.   And at that point, he got on and said, ""We love you, you're very special,"" and, you know, time to go home and so on. But it's extremely revealing how exactly he went about making those statements and we're going to let everybody see parts of that.   COOPER:  So this was the statement, just so I'm clear, this was the statement that he made on the day of the insurrection, or was it the day after?   RASKIN:  Oh, I guess you're referring to the one the day after when he made another speech, but also, you know, there was a statement made on the day of, at the end of the day.   COOPER:  And you have outtakes on that one as well?   RASKIN:  Now, actually, I'm not sure that we have outtakes on -- I'm not sure we've got outtakes on that one. It's the other one we've got outtakes on. But we certainly have snippets from this one, also, on the 6th.   COOPER:  You have snippets of the one on the 6th.   Obviously, your investigation is ongoing. What does the Committee's timeline look, and you may not know, what does it Committee's timeline look like, after tomorrow's hearing? I mean, what do you do the next day? Is there a ballpark for when you plan to issue a final report? Potential criminal referrals to the Justice Department if there will be any? Other hearings?   RASKIN:  Well, this should be the end of this block of hearings, but never say never in this process, because new material and new evidence is surfacing all the time.   But I think that the Committee is continuing the investigation. There are some important new leads that have opened up, so I wouldn't be surprised if there could be another hearing or two down the road.   And certainly, we need to do a hearing to discuss our conclusions and the recommendations that we're making for fortification of American democracy, against coups and interactions and political violence and attempts to steal away the will of the people and take over elections, which is what we saw with January 6th in which alas, continues to go on with the same forces that were arrayed against us on that day.   [20:10:06]   COOPER:  And the story that the Wisconsin Assembly Speaker said the former President called him last week as part of a fresh effort to decertify the state's 2020 election results, what does it say to you that I mean -- he is down at Mar-a-Lago playing golf, but he's even now trying to overturn election results while your investigation is ongoing?   RASKIN:  Well, to me, what it says is that, although Donald Trump knows full well that he lost the election by more than seven million votes and 306 to 232, in the Electoral College, even though everyone around him knew that and knows that and tried to convince them of it, he still wants to propagandize his followers in the Big Lie.   I mean, for him, it's become a litmus test also, for politicians like Mastriano in Pennsylvania; again Cox, in Maryland. These people are true believers, who will follow anything that the cult leader has to say and so, he uses it as a litmus test to see who is loyal to him and who is not.   It's a very scary and degraded thing to see this take place in the world's first modern democracy.   COOPER:  Yes. Congressman Raskin, I appreciate your time tonight. Thank you.   RASKIN:  Thanks for having me.  COOPER:  We're going to get perspective now from conservative attorney  and ""Washington Post"" contributing columnist, George Conway, also CNN special correspondent Jamie Gangel.   Jamie, given what Pottinger and Matthews witnessed in the White House on January 6th, what do you expect to hear in their testimony tomorrow?   JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Anderson, I'm told that it's going to be very dramatic. These were two White House aides who were in the White House on January 6th. They are firsthand fact witnesses.   I'm told that Sarah Matthews will talk about how they tried to get Trump to say something, but could not. And Matt Pottinger, we should note, he was at the White House for four years on the National Security staff. He knew Trump well.   I'm told he did not see Trump on the 6th. But he did see Mark Meadows. There will be key testimony about that. And also, as we've reported, they both resigned that day. I think that that is key to this point of dereliction of duty.   One source told me that they were both very upset because Trump wouldn't say to the rioters stop, leave, and that these two aides will say he didn't say that because he didn't want them to stop and leave.   COOPER:  George, I want to play what Attorney General Merrick Garland -- some more of what he said today.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   GARLAND:  No person is above the law in this country. Nothing stops us -- no -- I don't know how to need to say that again.   No person is above the law in this country. I can't say it any more clearly and that there is nothing in the principles of prosecution and any other factors which prevent us from investigating anyone -- anyone -- who is criminally responsible for attempting to undo a democratic election.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  Do you think that changes if Trump runs? I mean, you know, it is one thing to say that, but if the President -- if the former President announces he is running, does that change the calculus for the Department of Justice potentially?   GEORGE CONWAY, CONSERVATIVE ATTORNEY:  Not at all, it shouldn't. In fact, it should enhance the calculus for the Department of Justice, because what we're going to see tomorrow is something that we've never seen in 233 years, we've had Presidents of the United States.   The first President George Washington, sworn in 233 years ago and this January 6th was the single worst day of the presidency, because you had a President who went AWOL, who basically, he engaged in a supreme dereliction of his duty when a crowd was attempting to stop the peaceful transfer of power, was attempting to basically overthrow the Constitution.   We had a President of the United States who was sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, who did nothing for 187 minutes, and we're going to hear evidence of how he did nothing, which was to ignore people who were telling him, ""Please do something, Mr. President,"" and to watch television. We haven't heard the testimony yet. But we know from published reports, that he was just watching television gleefully.   And this is something we've never ever seen before, and it goes to his criminal intent. He did everything he could to overturn that election for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks, and then between 1:10 PM and 4:17 PM on January 6, 2021, he did nothing.   And the reason why he did nothing, you know in contrast to the energetic attempts to overthrow the election that preceded it was he viewed the attack on the Capitol as an effort, as one more way to try to overturn the election result and that's criminal. And if Attorney General Garland means when he says, it should be prosecuted.   [20:15:20]   COOPER:  Yes, you know, Jamie, I'm not even sure the phrasing that he did nothing is accurate, because, in fact, by doing nothing, he was in fact, doing all he could to encourage the attack, to continue the attack, to prolong the attack, clearly, because he wanted it to succeed.   He wanted to see, would they reach Mike Pence? Would they stop the vote? I mean, it wasn't just, he didn't know what to do and he wasn't doing anything. He was watching the well-laid plans that he no doubt discussed with, you know, Steve Bannon and his cronies and Field Marshal Mike Flynn play out.   GANGEL:  No question about it, and you may remember we've had reporting that, in fact, not only was he watching it, he was rewinding it to watch it again, that he was enjoying this, and I think we're going to hear a lot about that also from someone else who was at the White House, and that is White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, who my sources tell me that that testimony will be on videotape, but I'm told we will see a lot of Pat Cipollone, that he is a star witness tomorrow.   And there is a reason the Committee pushed so hard to get Pat Cipollone to give this videotaped testimony. I am told we will see just why tomorrow when they show it.   COOPER:  And George, do you think any of the former President's associates or allies like, you know, former Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows could face legal exposure in the wake of these hearings?   CONWAY:  Yes. Absolutely. I mean, Mark Meadows was facilitating all of this. He was facilitating the rally, he facilitated Team Crazy coming in. He was in the thick of it. And he was -- he definitely absolutely has had involvement with the situation in Georgia where they were trying to put the arm on Raffensperger to find those votes.  Meadows very, very deeply involved here and he is very deeply exposed.  COOPER:  George Conway, Jamie Gangel, thank you. Appreciate it.   Next, the prosecution resting in Steve Bannon's contempt of Congress trial after showing the jury evidence of his defiance in his own words, we will tell you how defense might rebut that, and the rest of what looks like a very clear case and what Bannon is really up to when we continue.   And later, whether it's wildfires, which you've been watching, these rising temperatures, falling water levels, just plain human misery, we're going to bring the latest to what is now a global heatwave.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   [20:22:04]   COOPER:  Three days into the contempt of Congress trial of Steve Bannon, the prosecution has rested, but not before the defense and cross examination again tried to portray the former President's one time political strategist is willing to cooperate with the House January 6 Committee and not before the prosecution showed more evidence he was defying it openly.   More now from CNN's Sara Murray who was inside the DC Federal Courtroom.   So the Judge is allowing questions about Bannon's recent Hail Mary bid to cooperate with the January 6 Committee. How did that play out?   SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right and as part of it, Bannon's attorney was asking is how Select Committee staffers, so you know, you guys have been in contact with him, are you still open to getting information? And this Select Committee staffer said, you know, we are still open to getting information.   But when prosecutors circled back with her on the redirect, they pointed out hey, these recent letters, Bennie Thompson very clearly states, even if you give us information now, this doesn't mean that you complied with a subpoena, you still defied it. Your contempt of Congress stuff still stands.   They also narrowed in on the fact that Bannon did not make this offer right after he was charged. He did not make this offer in the months that follow that. He only came to the Committee with this offer on July 10th, which was about a week before he was set to go to trial -- Anderson.   COOPER:  The defense also used a book club membership to try and show bias of the January 6 Committee staffer who testified. What was that about?   MURRAY:  Yes. You know, the defense doesn't have a lot that they can argue in this trial. One of the things they can try to make the case is that, you know, perhaps someone who was involved in this was biased. So they pointed to the fact that this House Select Committee staffer, and one of the prosecutors on this case used to be in a book club together as a suggestion that, you know, perhaps this witness was biased.   In reality, neither of these two women have either maybe even been to the book club in the past year. So, we'll see how that sits with the jury -- Anderson.   COOPER:  And in terms of a timeline, do we know how soon the jury might begin deliberations?   MURRAY:  Well, the caveat is always you can't predict what is going to happen in Court, right? Tomorrow, the defense gets to put forward their case. What we don't know is if the defense is going to put a case on. We don't know if they're actually going to call any witnesses. And we don't know if they're going to call on Steve Bannon and if he's going to take the stand and testify on his own behalf. So, that's a big question.   If they don't put forward a case, if they don't put forward witnesses, it is possible this could go to the jurors tomorrow.   COOPER:  Sara Murray, appreciate it. Thanks.   We are always glad at moments like this to be joined by Bloomberg Businessweek national correspondent, Joshua Green, author of ""Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency."" Also, CNN chief legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, former Federal prosecutor.   Jeff Toobin, just on what went on today, what do you think of the development?   JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST:  You know, when you hear that a case is just two witnesses, and basically a day of testimony, you think, ""Wait a second, there has to be something more to this?"" And the answer is no, there is nothing more to this. I mean --   COOPER:  Not even the book club?   TOOBIN:  That's right. That was the big got-cha in the cross examination. There's nothing to this case.   He got a subpoena. He didn't show up. He didn't produce the documents. He didn't challenge it in Court. He didn't try to get a delay. He bragged that he didn't cooperate. That's the whole case.   [20:25:04]   TOOBIN:  I mean, you know he is innocent until proven guilty except he is guilty. I mean, there's just nothing to this case.   COOPER:  Josh, when you and I last spoke, you said one of Bannon's biggest motivations would be to try to create a bigger spectacle as possible to undermine the January 6 Committee. I mean, he tried to do that yesterday with this, you know, statement he made outside the Courtroom, sort of trying to challenge, you know, Bennie Thompson in a mano-y-mano, you know, arm wrestling tournament or something, if he would show up in Court.   It just looks kind of sad, but what do you think of -- what did Bannon get out of this?   JOSHUA GREEN, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK:  I don't think he got anything out of it. If anything, I think it backfired on him, because the Judge in Court today said, surely he was alluding this, he said: ""I do not intend for this to become a political circus."" And at every stage, he has shut down Bannon and his defense's efforts to turn it into one by subpoenaing Nancy Pelosi and all of these other sorts of things he wants to do to kind of seize control.   So it really will be interesting to see whether the defense allows him to testify on his own behalf, because it's hard to imagine him, you know, being on good behavior and not sort of exploding in some way that, you know, undermines what little case the defense seems to have.  COOPER:  Jeff, do you think Bannon will actually testify?   TOOBIN:  You know, I think this is classic bully behavior. You know, when you're standing at a press conference, it's like, we're going to go medieval on their asses.   You know, and then on his podcast. He is like the big tough guy. But when it comes to testifying under oath, where you have to follow the rules of evidence, where you're subject to cross examination, I don't think he's going to go anywhere near the witness stand because that's not the forum he will excel in.   COOPER:  Josh, does Steve Bannon still matter at all? I mean, yes, he was once on the cover of ""Time."" Yes, he was involved in the President's campaign, and then he was out of the orbit. I know he's supposedly building this network of, you know, people who are going to run for School Boards and stuff and try to destroy institutions from inside.   Is that for real? Is that something people should be worried about? Or is he just this, you know, dude with a podcast and there's a lot of them?   GREEN:  No, I think what he's doing is real and I think he's got a bigger role than that. I mean, he is still, as we can see from what we know about what happened on January 6th in the days and weeks leading up to it, he is still the chief propagandist for Donald Trump, you know, spinning this alternate narrative that is powerful enough that, you know, thousands people showed up at the Capitol and rioted, and countless Republicans still believe this misinformation about how Joe Biden isn't the rightful President.   Like Steve Bannon has a big hand in spinning that narrative, but again, it is all based on fantasy and hyperbole and nonsense. And it's hard to kind of lean on that when you're under oath in Court.   COOPER:  If he's convicted, Jeff, I mean, what? It is a misdemeanor.  TOOBIN:  It's a very weird statute where misdemeanors are usually no  jail time required and a year maximum. The two counts each carry a 30- day minimum. So if he's convicted of both counts, he's looking at 60 days at a minimum in jail. He could get more.   But I mean, this is not a big jail --   COOPER:  Can he podcast from jail?   TOOBIN:  I doubt it. Only Jeffrey Epstein gets to live his life that way when he's in prison. That he did for a while.   COOPER:  It didn't end well.   TOOBIN:  No.   COOPER:  Jeff Toobin, Josh Green, thanks so much. Appreciate it.   Coming up, an election denier wins the Republican nomination for Governor of Maryland after Democrats spent more than a million dollars trying to turn out support for that right-wing candidate.   David Axelrod joins us next to discuss this controversial high-risk strategy.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   [20:32:30] COOPER: There's concern and criticism tonight over Democratic strategy to help fund far-right candidates in Republican primaries. The plan is that these candidates have nominated would be so toxic for moderate voters that it would help Democrats the fears they might actually win the election. The latest is Dan Cox who CNN projects will win the Republican nomination for governor in Maryland. Cox is an election denier after the 2020 election. He said the former president should cease voting machines. He also charted three buses to the January 6 rally and he tweeted during the attack on the Capitol quote, Pence is a traitor. According to Open Secret, a news site that tracks politics and money, Democrats spent more than a million dollars on TV ads highlighting the former president's endorsement of Cox, a tactic which was designed to boost his candidacy during the primary with Republicans but also harm it during the general election. Open Secret also reports the Democrats have spent nearly $44 million on ad campaigns in at least five states, California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Illinois, as well as Maryland. I'm joined now by CNN senior political commentator, David Axelrod and former senior adviser President Obama. Dave, is this a smart strategy? DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, we'll see. It's certainly been smart in the short run if the goal is to nominate extreme candidates who you think will be easier to beat. But the reason that they're going to these lengths is that this is, this could be a very tough year for Democrats that are gale force winds blowing in against Democrats. And so they wanted the most beautiful candidates. But those gale force winds could actually blow one of these candidates in. And, you know, Doug Mastriano, in Pennsylvania, who's quite extreme on elections, on abortion on many other issues, not unlike Cox, he's right here, you know, the initial polls in that race after his nominated had him four points behind the Democratic candidate. So, you know, it could be shrewd, or it could end disastrously and that's and that's the danger, Anderson. COOPER: Democrats have done this before, most notably the 2012 Senate race in Missouri --  AXELROD: Yes. COOPER: -- where Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill help Republican Congressman Todd Akin to get on the ballot against her. That was successful for her. Has it ever been done in this scale with this much at stake? AXELROD: No. Yes, that Akin race, that McCaskill race had took on mythic, mythic importance or significance and people reach into that grab bag this year, and what happened was it started in Pennsylvania in the Mastriano race, it proved successful. Though I think Mastriano might have won, anyway. And then it transported to Illinois onto Colorado in a Senate race where it didn't actually work in these other states. [20:35:19] Yesterday was noteworthy because the candidate who won Cox, I think, spent only $21,000 from his own campaign. COOPER: Wow. AXELROD: The Democratic Governors Association spent over a million. And remember, these ads are not, they're not distorting their records, they're amplifying them. They're, you know, most of these ads are the same. They say too conservative for Maryland, too conservative for Pennsylvania, but it says they're anti-abortion, they're pro-Trump, they've you know, and they go through all the credentials that will make them objectionable, in theory to moderate voters. But our music to the ears of core base, Trump oriented primary voters and you know, it's it obviously has worked to great effect in several of these cases. COOPER: I mean, it is a little weird to have Democrats, you know, warning that some of these candidates are a threat to democracy, and at the very same time, making sure that they win their primaries and on the ballot in November, I mean. AXELROD: Yes, listen, Anderson, you know, I spent 30 years in campaigns, or thereabouts. And, you know, I'm not an ingenue. And I understand the idea is to win and I understand the thinking behind these tactics. But as I said earlier, they come with great risk. And, you know, your hand handling plutonium here, as it relates to democracy and if something goes wrong, if those gale force winds are such that, you know, a Republican is blown across the finish line, you'll have people like in Pennsylvania, the governor there appoints the Secretary of State who administers the election. So this has the potential to be a disaster if it goes wrong. So, as I said at the beginning, it may seem smart today, it may seem tragically wrong in November. COOPER: David, I bet you are mistaken often for an ingenue, though. AXELROD: No, a lot of people say you'd be surprised I get that all the time. COOPER: I have to go look up the exact definition of ingenue. AXELROD: I should too. Now I said it on national television. COOPER: Just last, excuse me. Lastly, there's been a lot of reporting about President Trump running for president again, the narrative is more of when he'll announce or you know, when he'll announce or we will be announcing or when not will. Do you think he will? AXELROD: I think he will. Yes, I think you know, he's not very subtle. He generally signals what he's going to do. And he's been signaling that he's going to do this. And I think all of these legal threats probably encouraged him to do it. The ascension of people like DeSantis, encouraged him to do it. And his need to be the center of attention, encourages him to do it. But I'll tell you what, there is a group of people who don't want him to do it. And that's Republican officeholders. And there are a group of people who do and that's Democratic officeholders and strategists. If he plunges himself into the middle of these midterm elections, he could change the equation in a dramatic way. COOPER: David Axelrod, appreciate it. AXELROD: Good to see you. COOPER: Just ahead, the extreme heat that is fueling fires in Europe and forcing Yellowstone National Park to issue a new high level fire warning. And in China complicating efforts to maintain their controversial zero COVID policy. We have a stunning live report from Beijing, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:42:19] COOPER: Europe right now is battling wildfires caused by the extreme global heat that many of us are living through right now. Just outside of Athens, Greece, firefighters spent a second day trying to control blazes that have been fueled in part by strong winds. Firefighters from Romania also assisting in battling the deadly fires at least 600 had been evacuated including a children's hospital. In the United States, Yellowstone National Park now warns that the area's under high fire danger level there are no active wildfires right now. But they say a high fire danger level means wildfires are likely and that it could be difficult to control in certain areas under certain windy conditions. And CNN Selina Wang reports from China the extreme heat has complicated already tough situation for that country zero COVID policy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Scorching temperatures sweep over China turning mass COVID testing into a dangerous task. Steep media shows COVID workers collapsing on the job due to what the video say or heatstroke. In eastern China, a COVID worker vomits on the ground as colleagues rush to tear off her hazmat suit, unable to stand. She's carried away. It's a scene playing out across China, fainting, falling, crumbling on the ground, lying motionless. Struggling to breathe. The COVID workers long hours in the suffocating heat made worse by their head to toe full body protective gear. That is not water, according to state media. Its sweat gushing out of this workers hazmat suit, the sweat pools inside the protective gear lining the inside of the rubber gloves. The surging temperatures coinciding with surging COVID cases. (on-camera): Cities across China, including here in Beijing require a recent COVID test in order to enter any public area. That means everyone young, old and sick all have to wait in long lines like these in the brutal heat. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's really hot, frustrated and, you know, exhausting and you feel like, and a lot of times you'll feel anxious because you have a sense to do. WANG (voice-over): To survive, COVID workers are getting creative, hugging giant blocks of ice placing them on their backs, laps and feet. Colleagues rub ice on each other and tape ice cold water bottles to themselves. Some authorities have now said COVID workers can wear PPE that does not cover their entire bodies. Dozens of cities have been experiencing record high temperatures. Last week, more than 80 cities issued red alert with some logging temperatures of more than 110 degrees Fahrenheit. In central China a museum closed after the roof melted. In Nanjing the city opened underground air raid shelters for people to escape the heat. [20:45:12] Meanwhile, crops are withering and dying under the high temperatures, the soil parched and cracked. The damage to China's crop production threatens to push up inflation, putting more pressure on an economy already devastated by the pandemic. But in zero COVID China, even health care workers hospitalized from heat exhaustion get a positive spin from authorities. This propaganda video shows government officials visiting COVID workers in the intensive care unit while showing the motionless patients in bed, the video rallies people to work together for victory against COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: Selina Wang joins me now from Beijing. The video in your piece is stunning. Have we already seen the worst of the heat wave in China? Is it going to get better? WANG: Well, Anderson, we have seen temperatures start to come down in parts of the country. But after that things could still get worse with more extreme weather expected in the coming months. Now this heat wave actually follows extreme flooding in China that has displaced millions of people. And this hitting a population that is still reeling from this harsh COVID lockdown that's making it more suffocating for people trapped at home and more dangerous, as you saw for those frontline health care workers. Now, according to a government report, temperatures in China are actually rising faster than the global average, which can make these extreme weather events more frequent, more intense. China is now making climate change a top priority. But the question is all of this too late. COOPER: And I mean, it looks like these are sort of propaganda videos that Chinese government is making about the COVID workers collapsing. What's the message they're sending with these? WANG: Yes, some of the videos were very striking the last one, I wouldn't necessarily say it's a celebration of the sacrifice, but they're showing an example that these health care workers collapsing over and over again, being in the ICU for heatstroke, it shows the amount of sacrifice and dedication that these frontline workers are giving towards trying to fight COVID. It kind of fits into this more militant rhetoric in China towards trying to combat this virus or treating it like an all out war battle on the pandemic and that it's a reminder that music at the end you saw there was motivational, it's a reminder to people that this is a time where everybody needs to play their part. Anderson. COOPER: Selina Wang, appreciate it. Here in the U.S., the one powerful now disbarred attorney charged with murdering his wife and youngest son what Alex Murdaugh told the judge today about the charges against him, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:51:45] COOPER: Disgraced former South Carolina Attorney Alex Murdaugh has pleaded not guilty to all charges in connection to the murders of his wife and son who were found shot to death last year. Just after the killings, Murdaugh was thought by many to be a grieving widower, then came more twists and turns and what you find on the South Carolina country road. Culminating in an indictment last week on two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime for the two deaths. With more on what happened in court today, here's our Randi Kaye. And a warning some of the language is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Alex Murdaugh arriving at South Carolina's Colleten County court house to face murder charges. By the time he entered the courtroom, he changed from his blue jail jumpsuit into street clothes and Gucci shoes, all of which we've learned belong to one of his lawyer sons. CREIGHTON WATERS, PROSECUTOR: What's that you Richard Alex Murdaugh, are you guilty or not guilty of the felonies were in new stand indicted. ALEX MURDAUGH, FMR ATTORNEY: Not guilty. KAYE (voice-over): Murdaugh pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife Maggie and youngest son Paul on June 7th last year. The two were found shot to death at the family's property in Islandton, South Carolina. A. MURDAUGH: I need the police and ambulance immediately. My wife and child have been shot badly. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And what is your name? A. MURDAUGH: My name is Alex Murdaugh. KAYE (voice-over): Alex Murdaugh called 911, he said he found them shot after returning from visiting his mother. But just last week he was charged with killing them. Both were shot multiple times according to the indictment, Maggie with a rifle and Paul with a shotgun. A source with knowledge of the investigation confirmed to CNN, Alex Murdaugh had blood spatter on his clothes, which could prove he was in close proximity to at least one of the victims when they were shot. No motive has been disclosed. In court today, attorneys on both sides requested a gag order and refused to speak with the media. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Evidence in this case is substantial. And it all comes back to Alex Murdaugh. KAYE (voice-over): Murdaugh's attorneys also requested a speedy trial beginning this fall. RICHARD HARPOOTLIAN, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: We believe he's innocent, we believed that the killer or killers are still at large, and this would allow swear but this behind them and go over the real (INAUDIBLE). KAYE (voice-over): Alex Murdaugh said nothing beyond his not guilty plea. He sat at the defense table not far from a portrait on the wall of his grandfather who served as Solicitor here until 1986. Murdaugh has been in jail charged with dozens of financial crimes since September last year. CNN has obtained over 13 hours of recordings of his jailhouse phone calls. He often talked with his only surviving son Buster, about football, gambling, jailhouse workouts and plans for when perhaps if he gets out. A. MURDAUGH: We got to deal with all mom's stuff when I get out. I got to go deal with all mom's stuff in storage. KAYE (voice-over): At one point they talked about guns. A. MURDAUGH: So you don't have your 20 gauge. BUSTER MURDAUGH, ALEX MURDAUGH'S SON: Yes, I've got my 20 gauges, but I don't have -- I mean they took, they took all the 12 gauges and they took all the assault rifles. KAYE (voice-over): In one phone call from jail, Alex refer to a TV report he saw and mentioned the name Steven Smith and Gloria Satterfield to people in Murdaugh's orbit who mysteriously died. B. MURDAUGH: So, it's just that same old --  A. MURDAUGH: Steven Smith and Gloria and all that bullshit. Like it's a mystery surrounding Gloria's death about how she died? [20:55:08] KAYE (voice-over): Gloria Satterfield died in 2018 after falling down the steps at Murdaugh's home, Smith was found dead on a rural road in 2015. Both of those deaths are now under investigation by the state. Meanwhile, following court today, Murdaugh once again returned to jail, where he is being held on a $7 million bond on charges of financial crimes, including insurance fraud. (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: Randi joins us now from Charleston, South Carolina. The prosecution give any hints in court today about possible motive. KAYE: Anderson, no clear motive was spelled out in court today. But the prosecutor certainly hinted at what may be to come. He noted these 81 allegations that Alex Murdaugh is facing for fraud, for drugs, for financial crimes, all things that the grand jury had to consider when they decided to indict him in this double murder case. So the prosecutor said in court today, quote, a lot of that provides the background and motive for what happened on June 7, 2021. That was the day of the double murder when Alex Murdaugh's wife and son were both killed. So certainly he's trying to connect some of this history to a possible motive it seems we'll see what the defense has to say about that, Anderson. COOPER: Randi, thanks very much. Up next, the former president and close family members gathered to say goodbye to Ivana Trump. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [21:00:01] COOPER: Today here in New York City mourners gathered for Ivana Trump's funeral including the former president and their three children Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump. The first wife of the former president is being remembered as a loving mom, a grandmother, a powerful business woman who helped build the family's real estate empire such as it was. The former president on a social media platform called it a very sad day, but at the same time, a celebration of a wonderful and beautiful life. Ivana Trump was found unconscious, unresponsive at the bottom of a staircase in her townhouse last week. Authorities say she died a blunt impact injuries to her torso. Ivana Trump was 73.

You know, we should mention that in Arizona, a temperature of 100 or 140 degrees is like a cool summer day there, but here in the UK, it is truly dangerous with the government telling people not to go anywhere and not to do anything until the heat subsides -- Erin.   ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST:  Incredible. Sara Sidner, thank you so much, live from London tonight.   Thanks to all of you for joining us.   AC 360 starts now.   ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Good evening.   The first trial of the first person charged with defying a subpoena to appear before the House January 6 Committee is now fully underway. We're not just talking about any person. This is Steve Bannon, one time ""Time"" Magazine cover boy who was in then out of the former President's administration in good graces, and whose name has come up again and again in the January 6 Committee hearings.   In opening statements today, Federal prosecutors argue that the now right-wing podcaster put himself above the law. The defense suggesting that two contempt of Congress charges against him were politically motivated.   Proceedings began today after the Judge in the case, Carl Nichols, who is a Trump appointee denied a defense request for a month-long delay. You'll recall the last week, he rejected a number of defenses, including Bannon's claim of executive privilege, leading one Bannon defense attorney to ask and these are his words: ""What's the point of going to trial if there are no defenses?"" To which the Judge who replied, ""Agreed.""   Now remember, this is the same Steve Bannon who promised as he made his first Court appearance to make this ""A misdemeanor from hell."" It is the same Steve Bannon who even as he recently offered to appear live before the Select Committee, expressed contempt for its members and continued his tough guy routine, trying to set conditions for his testimony.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   STEVE BANNON, HOST, ""WAR ROOM"":  Here's what I need. Give me a date, a time, a room number, a microphone and a Holy Bible I can take the oath on. Boom. Deliver that and we'll see how good you are, little Jamie Raskin and Liz Cheney and all of it. Serve it up.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  Surprise, he isn't speaking about himself in the third person. Generally when people view themselves as really important, they reach peak pomposity and then they generally tend to do that.   Now, for most people getting a subpoena to appear whether before Congress or in Court means just that, you appear. There is no option to negotiate terms, of course, it hasn't stopped members of the former administration from trying. There is certainly no option to simply say no as Bannon has and it is understandable why a Committee focused on January 6th and what led up to it might want to hear from Steve Bannon. He was after all a leading cheerleader and by his own claims, a leading voice in it all.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   BANNON:  Live from our nation's capital, you're in the field headquarters of one of the small divisions of the bloodless coup. Step by step by step, day by day, understanding we're all going to converge on that point on the 6th.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   CARLSON:  He said a lot of things like that, more specifically though, the Committee is interested in his calls with the former President and what he said after one of them.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   REP. STEPHANIE MURPHY (D-FL):  The Committee has learned from the White House phone logs that the President spoke to Steve Bannon, his close adviser at least twice on January 5th. The first conversation they had lasted for 11 minutes.   Listen to what Mr. Bannon said that day after the first call he had with the President.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   BANNON:  All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. It's all converging. And now we're on as they say, the point of attack, right? The point of attack tomorrow.   I'll tell you this. It's not going to happen like you think it's going to happen. Okay, it's going to be quite extraordinarily different, and all I can say is strap in.   MURPHY:  From those same phone logs, we know that the President and Mr. Bannon spoke again on the phone that evening, this time for six minutes.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  Now Judge Nichols again, a Trump appointee has ruled out executive privilege on a number of other potential defense arguments leaving Steve Bannon with not many options and no way to make good on this threat.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   BANNON:  Pray for our enemies. Okay. Pray for -- because we're going to medieval on these people. We're going to savage our enemies, so pray for them. That's -- who needs prayers? Not MAGA. Not ""War Room"" and certainly not Stephen K. Bannon.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  And I spoke too soon. He is actually now speaking about himself in the third person, and I must say sounding kind of like I did when I was 11 years old and playing Dungeons and Dragons.   CNN's Katelyn Polantz was in the DC Federal Courtroom today and was outside, when, as we mentioned moments ago, Steve Bannon spoke out. What was it like inside the Courtroom today?   KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, Anderson, when we arrived this morning, we really thought that it was going to be very smooth this case would get off very quickly, the jury would be seated and we'd be off to the races with opening statements. That is not what happened at all.   And I actually want to highlight a little bit of what Steve Bannon said outside the Court because it echoed some of the strategy that his lawyers were trying to inside the Court.   Here he is after Court ended today.   [20:05:05]   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   BANNON:  Bennie Thompson sent a staffer over here. Where is Bennie Thompson? We subpoenaed Thompson and they are hiding behind these phony privileges.   He is too gutless to come over here himself. He's made it a crime, made it a crime, not a civil charge of wanting my testimony, but a crime. And he didn't have the courage or guts to show up here and he sent a staffer.   I challenge Bennie Thompson today to have the courage to come to this Courthouse. He's going to charge somebody with a crime. He's going to be man enough to show up here.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   POLANTZ:  So he's calling for a House Select Committee Chair Bennie Thompson to come down the street to testify in Court. That sounds like political bluster, but that's actually something that his attorneys have tried to argue in this case. They've wanted to subpoena Members of Congress, members of the Committee, Thompson himself. The judge has said, no, that's not going to happen at this time, maybe in a very sliver of a chance later on.   But right now, that wasn't going to happen, and that was really reflective of the approach in Court of his attorneys today. They kept trying to wedge things back into this case that the Judge had already said, it's not going to happen.   And really, that's what consumed most of the morning, I said, we thought that it was going to go smoothly, we ended up not starting with the jury sworn in until about one o'clock, and that's because his attorneys kept asking for things. They kept raising things like that they wanted to delay the trial again. They asked for a month delay, maybe delay it to on Friday, or on Monday, the Judge said no, they're also not going to be able to bring executive privilege, what Donald Trump was telling him, what his attorneys were telling him into this case, as we know it right now.   COOPER:  What's the core of the case the government has put together against him?   POLANTZ:  Well, the government's case is simple. It's straightforward. It's efficient. That's how they have been approaching it from the beginning. And that's really what we saw from them today in their opening statements.   They framed it as, this isn't just a contempt of Congress case. Steve Bannon has contempt for Congress. And they really tried to simplify this down for the jury not get into the privilege ideas, which they really can't. And they really, really wanted to show that Bannon had a firm date where he needed to turn over documents and where he needed to show up for testimony and he defied that willingly. That is what they have been trying to show.   And one of their witnesses, we saw the first witness today, Kristin Amerling. She's a deputy with the House Select Committee. The questions were very straightforward for her. Did he turn over documents on that date he needed to? October 7th? She said, he did not.   And then she was asked, did he show up for testimony at 10:00 AM on October 14th, the date his subpoena said he should, and her answer was, he did not.   COOPER:  Katelyn Polantz, thanks. Appreciate it.   Joining us now, CNN senior investigative correspondent, Drew Griffin whose special report on Steve Bannon ""Divided We Fall"" aired over the weekend; also CNN contributor and former Watergate star witness, John Dean who served as White House Counsel in the Nixon administration; and CNN senior political correspondent Abby Phillip, anchor of CNN ""Inside Politics"" Sunday.   What do you make of Bannon's defense here, John? What is -- of his argument?   JOHN DEAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  It's a very weak defense. He's really trying to say this is a witch hunt and everything is political. Well, of course, it's political. It's a political body that took this action against his contempt. But it's not a winning argument, because the government is just going to shred it, and say, of course, they're political, and they're doing what they're charged to do by the House and he is defying it, so it's a pretty simple case.   COOPER:  Abby, we saw, you know, Bannon leave the court as Katelyn was talking about and try to get into some sort of like mano-y-mano challenge with Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, chiding him for not showing up. Bennie Thompson, actually, I mean, has an important job. Steve Bannon is a podcaster accused of breaking the law, and the staffer who apparently was on the witness stand, I assume that's the staffer who was sent was basically just asked basic questions: Did he provide documents? Did he show up?   ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I mean, that as Katelyn said, the government's case is pretty straightforward. Steve Bannon was served a subpoena, he didn't answer it, didn't even attempt to answer it, and showed contempt for the process, for the institution of Congress. And that, as far as Steve Bannon is concerned is the point.   I mean, Bannon, has always been about really undermining institutions like Congress, defying them flagrantly in an effort to make the point that they are in his mind, illegitimate and so it doesn't surprise me that these proceedings have gone along these lines with Bannon continuing to put on a show for his podcast audience. That is ultimately what this is about.    He really does have an audience of one at the end of the day, and that is still Donald Trump. I still think that in a lot of ways Bannon is acting in a way that he believes Trump would be pleased with and in fact from the evidence that we have, Trump is pleased with how Bannon has been defying Congress up until this point.   [15:10:05]   COOPER:  Drew, as we mentioned, you did this fascinating CNN report about Bannon, the Special Report, and I want to play one particularly relevant part of that for our viewers.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Outside a recent hearing in his case, CNN caught up to Steve Bannon.   GRIFFIN (on camera):  Why do you continue to push the lie that the 2020 election was stolen?   BANNON:  It is not a lie.   GRIFFIN:  It's a lie. You have no proof. So, we've looked at all the facts.   BANNON:  You haven't --   GRIFFIN:  You don't have the facts. Rudy doesn't have the facts.   BANNON:  I'll tell you -- hold on. Hold on. Hey, do me a favor, get this guy, I want to sit down with you this week for two hours and we're going to go through all the evidence.   GRIFFIN:  Okay. How about Friday?   BANNON:  Friday done.   GRIFFIN:  All right.   BANNON:  Done deal.   GRIFFIN (voice over):  Despite that pledge, the interview never happened. Bannon ultimately ignored all our requests for interviews.   (END VIDEO CLIP)   COOPER:  I should mention that Bannon's defense team used the airing of your documentary as an argument to delay his trial. That argument failed.   GRIFFIN:  Yes, like all his other motions and last minute appeals to try to stop this trial failed. Funny, he was promoting our documentary on his own show at the same time, his attorneys were telling a Judge because of the pretrial publicity, they should delay it.   But I feel for Congress, we were trying to get an interview with Steve Bannon for many, many months. He dragged us along or his people dragged us along. And then as you saw there, even after he promised to sit down and talk to us all about how the election was, in fact, stolen, he just blew us off, basically, because he can't defend that, Anderson.   He is just looking for a show, like Abby said. He can't reasonably defend any of his positions. And you know, the odds are that if he did answer his subpoena and walk into Congress, he wouldn't have been talking to Bennie Thompson anyway. He would have been talking to investigators who would be asking him about facts, not bluster.   COOPER:  And I mean, John, the Justice Department, you know, their argument is that the subpoena was mandatory, not optional. But as we have seen, there's a long list of people -- Mark Meadows and others -- who have just ignored these subpoenas. I mean, Mark Meadows sort of gave some information to the Committee, Dan Scavino. Does it hurt the DOJ's case at all against Bannon than others?  DEAN:  I don't think that's even relevant. I don't think it'll even  get into the case. Ben and Mike try to get it in, but it's not going to happen. He committed his crime. And that's what will be the focus.   COOPER:  It is that cut and dry?   DEAN:  It is cut and dry. Absolutely. And we can see it. This is a cut and dry Judge. He's having no play with this nonsense that is going on.   COOPER:  At Abby, Bannon told the January 6 Committee that he is now willing to testify, preferably at a public hearing, that's not going to happen. Is there any more clarity on how the Committee is ultimately going to handle Steve Bannon?   PHILLIP:  Yes, more than likely the Committee -- they've said -- Congresswoman Elaine Luria, one of the members of the Committee told CNN that they still want to talk to him. They will probably have an interview with him in a closed door setting, which they've done with all of their witnesses, a closed door setting first, and then possibly a public setting, but I don't think Bannon is going to be in the category of people that they are going to have in a public setting.   Bannon would make a mockery of that process and I think that they are very much aware of that what they want to do is just get him on the record. You know, I do think there are some questions about whether Bannon even really respects this idea that when you swear under oath, that you're not going to lie to Congress, that that means that you don't lie to Congress.   We'll see how that would turn out in a private interview. But ultimately, that's what the January 6 Committee wants. They want him under oath, on the record, probably with the lawyers and not even with the Committee members just to get on the record, whether he is pleading the fifth or his side of the story, as far as they're concerned.   COOPER:  Drew, the sort of various iterations of Steve Bannon sort of fascinating and your documentary, you know, kind of showed this, you know, on the cover of ""Time"" Magazine, you know, carried himself as the person who helped Trump win the presidency as a co-campaign manager, then fell out of favor with the White House, banished from the White House, Trump was bad mouthing him.   Now, Trump seems to like him again, and he's gained power politically within the Trump movement -- Trumpism -- from pushing the election lie.   GRIFFIN:  Yes. In our report, we looked at Steve Bannon and Steve Bannon is long game and it was a long game that began before Donald Trump, and I think that's what is the real danger here that we might be missing in some of this.   Steve Bannon has started a political movement based on a lie. We may all believe in our hearts that no one could possibly follow him. He is very adept at motivating people who believe in that lie and believe that they are somehow aggrieved by this election laws to action and he's getting people to run for offices who are election deniers and he's setting up a scene where in 2024, we may actually have election deniers who are overseeing the vote.   [20:20:15]   And that is the real danger that we found in our documentary, and he is doing it all on this podcast, which has millions and millions of followers who basically live within the echo chamber that he has developed, and I don't think you can overlook that in terms of his political power.   It's not just about Trump, it is about his view of what the United States and the world should be. And I think many people would be frightened of that.   COOPER:  Interesting. Drew Griffin, John Dean, and Abby Phillip, thank you.   Major development as well in Georgia investigation of attempts to overturn election results there and a big shift, prosecutors say that all 16 so-called fake electors who were part of the former President scheme and who signed an unofficial electoral certificate that was sent to the National Archives are now targets of a criminal probe. They've all gotten what are known as target letters.   CNN's Nick Valencia joins us now with the latest.   What more have you learned?   NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Anderson.   Yeah, this is major, so significant because it shows that District Attorney Fani Willis here could be inching towards potential criminal charges in her probe as she looks for potential election interference here in the State of Georgia.   Up until now, we know that the 16 electors had been -- some of them had been participating and cooperating with Willis, but this is the first time that we're hearing that these 16 electors could face potential criminal charges.   According to one of the attorneys, for many of these electors, some of them had been cooperating with Willis as witnesses, but not as targets, and all that changed according to court filings in late June when attorneys for Willis' office say that new evidence came to light.  Now attorneys for the electors are pushing back on this claim. They're saying that this is all a publicity stunt and that the electors agreed to be witnesses for Willis' investigation, but it was not in good faith.   But why this is so significant is that you know it shows that Willis is potentially inching closer towards these criminal charges, and it also shows Anderson just how wide ranging, wide reaching, and the broad scope of her investigation as well -- Anderson.  COOPER:  Is there any indication this investigation is drawing closer  to the former President?   VALENCIA:  There is, and it does suggest that this may be drawing closer to former President Trump, and we should remind our viewers it was earlier this month that seven key Trump allies were given subpoenas and that includes the former President's attorney Rudy Giuliani, as well as South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as five legal advisers to the Trump campaign.   Anderson, one thing is clear, we're going to see a lot of legal wrangling before there is any resolution to this all -- Anderson.   COOPER:  Nick Valencia, appreciate it.   Next, the Secret Service text messages the Select Committee wants from January 5th and 6th and why they don't have them yet. And what happens if they weren't deleted despite two warnings from Congress not to do that.   Later, big parts of Europe, not just baking in record high temperatures, but burning up as well. We'll show you where the worst of the heat and fires are and why this could be a sign of things to come, ahead.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   [20:22:08]   COOPER:  One of the hottest topics of the January 6th hearings is the role of the Secret Service, involving the former President's alleged anger when told he could not go to the Capitol or former Vice President's concern that his detail might whisk him away from the Capitol, keeping him from doing his duty.   Now, the Select Committee as you know, subpoena the Secret Service for any pertinent documents, calls, and text messages. Today, the agency delivered a first installment, but crucially minus any text.   CNN's Ryan Nobles at the Capitol for us tonight.   At this point, Ryan, is there any chance that the text messages in question can be recovered?   RYAN NOBLES, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  There is a question, Anderson, but no one seems to have the answer to it. The Secret Service can't seem to say with specificity whether or not they think these messages can be recovered. They're also even suggesting maybe these messages never existed, that their agency actually never used text messages to communicate during that crucial period of time.   The January 6 Select Committee keeps asking over and over again for specific information about where these texts are, and if they can ever be retrieved. I talked to Jamie Raskin earlier today, a member of the Committee and he said they just aren't getting those answers yet. But they promised that they were going to push forward and not quit asking those questions until they get the answers.   And then if they don't get the answers they're looking for, they'll try and figure out what to do next.   COOPER:  I mean, it's really an extraordinary situation, I mean, the idea that they on such an important event that there would be missing text messages, and then just the lack of clarity, still continuing.   NOBLES:  Yes, and I think that's an important part of this Anderson, is that part of what the January 6 Select Committee wants to know, is how these agents communicated with each other during this crucial period of time.   So if it wasn't through text messages, was it through some other form of communication, and that's part of the reason that they issued this subpoena, asking for a wide range of records so that they can sift through all of it and see if they can get the answers that they're looking for.   But there is no doubt that the Secret Service has been evasive in their answering of some of these questions. It's one of the reasons that the Inspector General was so frustrated by his look into this information, and it's one of the reasons that the Committee continues to press the Secret Service for answers.   COOPER:  They are not the only ones investigating these text messages.  NOBLES:  Yes, that's right. Now the National Archives is involved. They sent a letter today to the Department of Homeland Security, which is the agency that oversees the Secret Service, asking them to look into this lack of text messages being available between the days of January 5th and January 6th.   And the National Archives has a very specific request. They've given the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security 30 days to come up with an explanation for where these text messages, when Secret Service has said that they are ready to comply.   But Anderson, there is a lot of weight behind this request by the National Archives. It is against the law to delete or destroy Federal records. The National Archives could ultimately refer this information to the Department of Justice if they aren't satisfied with the answers that they're given by the Department of Homeland Security or Secret Service.   [20:25:12]   COOPER:  Ryan Nobles, appreciate it.   Now, as Ryan just mentioned, the National Archives is putting the Department of Homeland Security which oversees the Secret Service, as he said on notice. Chief Records Officer Laurence Brewer sending the department a letter asking for an explanation should the messages turn out to have been improperly deleted?   I'm quoting now from it: ""This report must include a complete description of the records affected, a statement of the exact circumstances surrounding the deletion of messages, a statement of the safeguards established to prevent further loss of documentation, and details of all agency actions taken to salvage, retrieve, or reconstruct the records."" The proverbial strongly worded letter.   Perspective now from former Kansas Governor John Carlin, who served as archivist at the National Archives and Records Administration, from 1995 to 2005.   Governor Carlin, do you think the request from the National Archives to the Secret Service is the appropriate action for them to take here?  JOHN CARLIN, FORMER ARCHIVIST OF THE UNITED STATES:  Absolutely, because quite frankly, one of the main functions of the Archives is to get access to records and without those records, you can't hold government accountable. That's across the board regardless of what situation we're talking about.   It's just a basic fundamental fact that without those records, you can't have the full accountability. And so absolutely, I've seen the letter that went out from the Archives, and laid out very specifically, they're carrying out their role as the keeper of all the records, with responsibility to seeing they are created, they are preserved, and made accessible.   COOPER:  How unusual is a request like this?   CARLIN:  Very unusual, very unusual. I mean, my time, I go back to 10 years working with the Nixon records, and that was a somewhat similar over a long period of time, but I can't think of any other experience where it got much attention.   COOPER:  Yes.   CARLIN:  There might be minor things that don't ever get in the press or out of the attention of just maybe a couple people in the Archives, but a situation like this, not very often.   COOPER:  Do the Archives have any way to enforce their request? Or is it basically up to the Secret Service to comply?   CARLIN:  It's up to the Secret Service. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the archives have no support or even appropriations for -- I mean, they're just doing it out with our basic budget now. And all they can do is, as this letter points out, very clearly, it is their responsibility.   The law is very clear. All presidential records are official records, permanent records to be made eventually available to the public in this case, before the public gets access totally.   COOPER:  And if the request isn't fulfilled or ignored by the Secret Service, what kind of precedent do you think that would set for the future?   CARLIN:  Well, it would be a very bad one, if not the Congress, or the Courts don't follow through and in some way, make it clear. The Archives have no -- I don't know if anything, any action they can take. But certainly, it would have to be a part of at least some of what is sent forward in the final January 6 Committee work.   And you know, what the Department of Justice can do, I do not know. But the Archives have done in a follow through and carried out their responsibility, and I'm proud of them.   COOPER:  The previous administration, obviously, flouted archiving laws, the former President reportedly ripped up documents that had to be taped back together, in some cases, brought classified documents down to Mar-a-Lago. The staff using encrypted apps to communicate.   Do you think that's a new standard? Or maybe a new low as far as archives are concerned? Do you worry about other administrations in the future, deciding, let's just use encrypted apps like they did?   CARLIN:  Anderson, what you've just shared, has to be dealt with, at some point very clearly by the government and I am not in a position to say, okay, who does what, but it has got to be made clear that future administrations cannot just use this as an excuse.   Somebody got away with it. That's established a pattern. No, that would be incredibly damaging to our democracy and the rule of law, it would be unbelievably damaging to this country if that became a pattern.   [20:30:14]   COOPER: Yes, Governor Carlin and I really appreciate your time tonight. Thank you. CARLIN: You're most welcome. Thank you for covering this. COOPER: Coming up, news just in to CNN Uvalde, District Police Chief Pete Arredondo, Shimon Prokupecz has been pushing for answers as he always does his report next based on his fate. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Tonight, there's new action under discussion against Uvalde School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo. As we told you last night the new report from Texas House committee says this about his response to the school shooting Robb Elementary quote, as events unfolded he failed to perform or to transfer to another person the role of incident commander. The police as you know more than an hour to finally store in the classroom killed the gunman, 19 students two teachers were killed in the shooting. Last night at the school board meeting in Uvalde, a relative of a fourth grade shooting victim demanded action from the school board. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRETT CROSS, RELATIVE OF SHOOTING VICTIM UZIYAH GARCIA: You're still standing by paying him to take a vacation, correct? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. When he is on administrative leave, we received this information yesterday one of the things that did say when he went on administrative leave that we were going to wait for investigative information to come forward to help us in our decision making and I will stick to that [20:35:02] CROSS: All right, well I'll tell you this, if he's not fired by noon tomorrow then I want your resignation and every single one of you board members because y'all do not give a damn about our children or us. Stand with us or against us, because we ain't going nowhere. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Joining us now from Texas is CNN's Shimon Prokupecz. Obviously a lot of very understandable angers they're being directed at Pete Arredondo. What have details have you learned tonight and whether or not he may be removed? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME & JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: While that process is underway, Anderson, I'm told that school by school officials that they want him terminated, they want him gone. They listened to those parents in that meeting last night I was there. And it was incredible to watch Anderson because it was really the first time, you know, we've heard them sort of demand accountability. But it was really the first time where you felt that they had confidence that they were coming together as one to ask for accountability. And that was the biggest thing that they all wanted, they wanted Pete Arredondo fire, they want him gone. And now it looks like that process is underway. School officials are listening to those parents. And I'm told that they do the school wants him terminated. So there's a process now and that process is underway. The one thing Anderson is that he could, he could resign before ultimately that decision is made final because he's under contract, there's other things going on here. So we wait to see what happens certainly in the next few days, Anderson. COOPER: I mean, you obviously repeatedly tried to talk to Chief Arredondo to get some very basic questions, you caught up with him back in early June. He wasn't forthcoming at all, I just want to play part of what he did said to you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE ARREDONDO, POLICE CHIEF, UVALDE SCHOOL DISTRICT: We're not going to release anything, we have people in our community (INAUDIBLE) --  PROKUPECZ (on-camera): I just want your reaction to --  ARREDONDO: -- we're going to, we're going to, we're going to be --  PROKUPECZ (on-camera): -- the (INAUDIBLE) saying that you are responsible for the decision. ARREDONDO: Right. (INAUDIBLE). PROKUPECZ (on-camera): We're going to that room. How do you explain yourself? ARREDONDO: We're going to be respectful to the family. PROKUPECZ (on-camera): I understand that. And have an opportunity to explain yourself to the parents. ARREDONDO: (INAUDIBLLE). And just so you know, we're going to, we're going to do that eventually, obviously. PROKUPECZ (on-camera): When? ARREDONDO: And whenever this is done that the families could grieving, then we'll do that obviously. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Again, whenever the families quit grieving, and he was trying to turn it on you as a you were being disrespectful of asking these questions while people were grieving as if there's some end to the grief. I spoke to Angel Garza last night the step dad of Amerie Joe Garza, who was murdered. He said, anyone who says they're withholding information for the benefit of the families is lying. If someone has any information on how this happened, they want it now. And he also talked about kind of the families coming together. CNN has reached out to our Arredondo's lawyer. Has there been any response? PROKUPECZ: No, there's been no response. But that's typical with Arredondo side. Look, Arredondo has talked, he talked to the Texas Tribune where he claimed he didn't get a sense that he was the on- scene commander. But when you look at that body cam footage Anderson, and you look at that hallway footage that was released, you can tell that yes, there was no leadership. But there are people on the body camera footage who are saying Pete Arredondo is with the gunman. He's there. He's in charge, he's making the decisions. You hear Pete Arredondo trying to negotiate with the gunmen. Some of the family members have watched that body cam footage have watched the hallway footage, and they watching that you could tell that in yesterday in their reaction to some of what they have seen. They have felt the confidence and the strength to come forward and demand accountability. And that is why they want information. That is why they need information so that they know, they know that something here is wrong. There was a cover up. They were not given the truth. And so they want those answers and then doesn't stop where Pete Arredondo, the family say they're going to go after other people, other people who are in that hallway, and also other school officials. COOPER: Right. And as the report says, I mean, there were a lot of different agencies there. And a lot of responsibility, which we need to learn more about. Shimon Prokupecz, appreciate it. Coming up, the global heat wave that has helped fuel wildfires across Europe and set record high temperatures and parts of the U.S., including Texas and Oklahoma. We've got a just a stunning video of what happened to one UPS driver trying to work in this environment. Plus a live report from Paris in what's going on. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:43:06] COOPER: Some newly obtained video we want to show you about this global heat wave. A UPS driver in Arizona last week was delivering packages in 108 degree weather. In the video, he seems to be having difficulty walking up to the house. He bends over to put down an envelope and slumped to the ground. He was motionless for 10 seconds and fell on his back. He then got back up rang the doorbell walked away. The man who lived inside the home didn't see the video until much later. He called police and UPS to check on the drivers safety. In a statement to CNN, UPS as the driver later called his supervisor for assistance. More than 100 million Americans are under heat alerts, record high temperatures in Texas and Oklahoma today. In Texas officials say a firefighter suffered heat exhaustion battling wildfire. The Texas A&M Forest Service's they expect the threat of fires remain extremely high, because it says about 99% of the state is experiencing some level of drought. And CNN's Melissa Bell reports to the extreme heat as a problem here as well as in Europe. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A fire rages through a field in Spain as homes burned. In Greater London, a house is swallowed by Wildfire. These just some of the many sweeping across Europe, where temperatures have soared and a heat emergency that stretches across the globe. China's heat wave began last week, with 51 cities including Beijing, now under the second highest heat alert level. European cities sweltered under new highs in what is the continents second heat wave of the summer, now entering its second week. Ireland seeing its hottest day in a century. In the United Kingdom temperatures reached 104 degrees, a first with London's fire brigade declaring a major incident on Tuesday because of a quote, huge surge and fires across the capital. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we just have to adapt simply. Our homes have to change our way of life has to change. Doesn't it. [20:45:02] BELL (on-camera): Here in France the temperatures reached 105 degrees, difficult enough for Paris which is not accustomed to such extreme temperatures. But down in the southwest of France, the impact has been far more devastating. The French president is due down by those wildfires that have been spreading for several days, under pressure from local officials who accused him of not having done enough, soon enough. (voice-over): Down near Bordeaux, wildfires have continued to spread, burning through still more of the parched pine forests that run all the way down to Spain. Already, tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes in southern Europe. The extreme heat causing fires in Texas and causing the plains to swelter all the way up to the Dakotas, temperatures as high as 110 feeling as high as 115. Experts say that climate change can no longer be ignored. DAVID WALLACE-WELLS, AUTHOR: We're talking about weather events that we probably would have expected to see, a decade or two down the line. But what's more striking than that, I think is how poorly we're preparing and adapting because we knew these temperatures were coming. BELL (voice-over): For many people across the northern hemisphere, this Tuesday brought those temperatures and there's weather events into far sharper focus. (END VIDEOTAPE) BELL: Anderson, here in Paris it's just started raining, a thunderstorm that's likely to prove short respite, that heat wave expected to continue into the middle of next week. And that of course, terrible news for those many hundreds of thousands of firefighters are trying to bring those fires under control, not just in Greece, Spain and Italy, countries that were accustomed to seeing them, the further north in Bordeaux and Brittany and as far north as London. Parts of the world where you just couldn't have imagined anything like this a few years ago and it is then when people flee their homes, when houses are destroyed, then that reality of climate change really comes home, Anderson. COOPER: Yes. Melissa Bell, appreciate it. Thank you. Stunning images. Just ahead, the politics of climate change here in the U.S. and how one Democratic senator thwarted his party's attempt to pass a bill that included efforts to fight climate change was Joe Manchin, motivated by his financial ties the coal industry. The answer that question, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:51:03] COOPER: Pressure is building a prison Biden to announce some kind of action on climate change, particularly after West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin last week told his fellow Democrats he would not support the climate provisions in a large economic package, the Democrats want to pass and campaign on. That's according to sources and spoke to CNN. One of those sources said that Senator Manchin had at one point actually supported the climate provisions plus taxes to help pay for the package, Democrats need his vote in the 50/50 Senate, Manchin is obviously up for reelection in two years in like a state benefits from the energy industry. CNN's chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju has more on what Joe Manchin maybe after. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): Let me make it let me be very clear on --  MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Progressives in Congress are fed up with Senator Joe Manchin. REP. MONDAIRE JONES (D-NY): It's hard to think of someone who has been more effective at undermining a president of his own party than Senator Manchin. SEN. MARTIN HEINRICH (D-NM): It's not fair to have to string people along for a year and not come to a conclusion. It's not an appropriate way to negotiate. SEN MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): The 50/50 Senate it sucks. So that's it. RAJU (voice-over): Biden initially wanted a $3.5 trillion bill to expand the social safety net. JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: The (INAUDIBLE) in these bills is what 81 million Americans voted for. RAJU (voice-over): For months, matched in the president negotiated with Manchin even secretly proposing the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, he would only agree to a bill about half its size. After the White House came down to $1.75 trillion, Manchin derailed the effort by saying he was filled with budget gimmicks. MANCHIN: This is a no on this legislation. RAJU (voice-over): But Schumer has been quietly in talks with Manchin on a scale back plan and after believing they were close to a $350 billion Climate and Energy Deal, along with tax hikes to pay for it, Manchin indicated he favored a narrower bill focused on prescription drug prices and health care subsidies. (on-camera): How do you respond to the criticism from your colleagues that you strung them along for an entire year and at the end of the day, you pulled the plug? MANCHIN: Yes, I never strung anybody along. I was the first one to raise the alarm on inflation. I'm worried about the person that can't feed their family. So I'm sorry if they don't care about that, I do. RAJU (voice-over): Manchin who lives on a 65-foot boat while in D.C. has been criticized for his ties to the energy industry as he has benefited from nearly a million dollars in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry over the past five years. He has financial holdings between 1 million and $5 million in a coal business he found it. But he says that has nothing to deal with his positions. (on-camera): They say it's your personal ties to the, that coal industry or financial ties. MANCHIN: You know what, everyone has a job, everyone has made a living or tried to make a living provide for their family, if they want to criticize that and looking for some reason, the bottom line is inflation. RAJU (voice-over): The reality, Manchin is a rare Democrat from a state that Donald Trump carried by nearly 40 points, with Manchin only winning reelection in 2018 by just three. The former West Virginia University football player and ex-governor, Manchin won his first race in 2010 after vowing to literally shut down his party's climate change bill. MANCHIN: I'll take dead aim at the cap and trade bill, cause it's bad for West Virginia. RAJU (voice-over): Moderate say he's reining in the party's extremes and credit him for helping broker in infrastructure package and the gun violence bill that Biden signed into law. (on-camera): Are you happy with the position he's taking these issues? REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX): I'm happy that he moderates many times. REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): He's with us 70, 75 80% of the time. Nobody agrees with everybody 100% of the time. RAJU (voice-over): And as he along with Senator Kyrsten Sinema have refused to change filibuster rules, he has become a GOP darling. (on-camera): Will you support him if he ran for reelection in 2024? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. RAJU (on-camera): How helpful has he been to Republicans in the (INAUDIBLE) Senate? SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I think he's been helpful to the country. [20:55:00] RAJU (voice-over): Some say he should just change parties. (on-camera): You keep hearing Republicans saying he should just join our conference. What do you think about? MANCHIN: We'll see later. (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU: There is still a strong likelihood Anderson that that some legislation could get to President Biden's desk in the coming weeks that focusing on healthcare issues, namely allowing Medicare, the power to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs, as well as extending those expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act for two years. Democrats are using a party line procedures under the budget rules to try to pass that but of course they need all 50 Democrats to get on board because no Republicans plan to join them. And that means at the end of the day, they need Joe Manchin. Anderson. COOPER: Manu Raju, great report. Thank you. Appreciate it. Up next, the worlds sharpest close up of Jupiter and its moons from the new space telescope designed to see billions of light years away. Incredible images. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Well, it's hot and the time is feel heavy. So we want to close with somebody that might take a little bit of mental load off. It comes again from NASA who last week showed the world several mind blowing images including galaxy cluster billions of light years away all from the James Webb Telescope, which has turned its focus on something much closer to planet earth. Here it is Jupiter, the biggest planet in our solar system, a mere 430 million miles away. It's the left to Jupiter is famous Great Red Spot a storm big enough to swallow earth according to NASA. You see the shadow of you Europa, one of Jupiter's orbiting moons as well. [21:00:03] There are also these new photos giving us another view of Europa and two other moons. And in another image you can see Jupiter it's hard to see rings. It's proof that Webb can pick up pale objects while also capturing detail on bright fast moving objects, both of which will come in handy as it explores Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn. The news continues.

Now according to the Committee's report, there were 376 law enforcement officers who responded to the scene, 376, and yet, as a full hour ticked away, not one of them managed to do what all first responders are trained to do, which is confront the killer immediately. Now, compounding that obscenity is how hard getting a straight answer has been from anyone about anything, and it has been like that from the very first day. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) SGT.

(END AUDIO CLIP) COOPER: That's a Sergeant with the Texas Department of Public Safety telling me about a school resource officer and others who supposedly engaged the shooter outside Robb Elementary. Now, that was a very early report, and it turned out he was wrong, which often happens. The next day, whoever his boss repeated it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:       There was a brave, Consolidated Independent School District resource officer that approached him, engaged him, at that time. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Again, that was not true. The killer faced no opposition on his way into Robb Elementary. And a day later, under intense scrutiny, a DPS Regional Director admitted it. But that was a minor detail compared with what would become the defining falsehood of the entire tragedy -- a falsehood the Governor of Texas assured people was fact. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): As horrible as what happened, it could have been worse. The reason it was not worse is because law enforcement officials did what they do. They showed amazing courage by running toward gunfire for the singular purpose of trying to save lives. And it is a fact that because of their quick response, getting on the scene, being able to respond to the gunman and eliminate the gunman, they were able to save lives. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Well, those are not facts and what he said is not true. Now, there were already -- even when he said that, there were already some obvious signs that something wasn't right. The timeline in the police response just didn't make a lot of sense, it took too long. Now, there is video from inside the school which explains why. It shows officers backing off after the gunman fired shots at them, the opposite of what their training called for, the opposite of what we were told, what parents were told the police did. Now, other footage shows officers milling around in hallways doing nothing. One officer as you see takes time to apply hand sanitizer. Governor Abbott would say he had been misled several days later and that he was ""livid"" about it, which may be true, but he's been pretty silent on the massacre ever since. There have been a litany of lies and myths characterizations by officials. We were told the authorities did not immediately confront the shooter because they thought he was no longer a threat then we've learned about the 9-1-1 calls which authorities knew about from kids inside the classroom with the shooter and that he certainly was a threat. [20:15:07] We were told the shooter barricaded himself inside the classroom, so he built some sort of a fortress, then we learned he was just behind an ordinary door, and it's not even definitively known if that was a locked door because no one apparently ever tried to -- tried the handle according to a report released yesterday. As for Chief Arredondo seen here trying to evade questions from our Shimon Prokupecz, he told the ""Texas Tribune"" that he never considered himself the incident commander during the shooting, and says he issued no orders for officers not to storm the classroom. The Texas Department of Public Safety he says the opposite on both, but whatever the label the new report from the Texas House committee has this to say about his performance and I am quoting now: ""As events unfolded, he failed to perform or to transfer to another person the role of incident commander."" Now, this was an essential duty he had assigned to himself, yet it was not effectively performed by anyone. We'll go to Uvalde and Shimon Prokupecz in a moment, but first I want to play you another moment that we've just gotten in from the School Board meeting from a Uvalde High School senior whose sister was murdered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAZMIN CAZARES, SISTER KILLED AT ROBB ELEMENTARY: How am I supposed to come back here? I'm going to be a senior. How am I supposed to come back to the school? What are you guys going to do to make sure I don't have to watch my friends die? What are you going to do to make sure I don't have to wait 77 minutes, bleeding out on my classroom floor, just like my little sister did? I know there is nothing you can do to bring my sister back. But maybe, just maybe if you do something to change this, you can prevent the next family from losing their child. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Well, more now on what we're learning about what went on inside the school from these videos. This is a new video being seen for the first time tonight from Shimon Prokupecz, who joins us from Uvalde. So there is a lot of this new body camera footage. Explain the importance of it what it shows. SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, you know, your show that podium, you know, you have the governor there the day after the shooting, trying to cast these officers as heroes. And now that we're getting all this video, you know, we had the hallway video and now this body camera video, it's hard to believe that no one on that stage, there was every law enforcement official from the area would somehow believe that these officers acted as heroes, right? Because they had access to certainly, in that hallway video that we have seen already, and what this body camera footage shows us is really what was going on through the minds of some of these officers as they were inside the school, as they were outside the school -- the confusion, the lack of leadership. You know, the one officer that we highlight in this video, was actually trying to do something. You can sense his anxiety. He knew something was wrong, but he just didn't know what he can do to sort of figure out how to get inside the classroom. And then we learned there was a moment, shockingly, a moment, perhaps as long as 40 minutes after the initial shooting, when officers learned that there were kids inside the classroom. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OFFICER: Made it to the building. OFFICER: Yes. PROKUPECZ (voice over): These are the first few moments from newly released bodycam footage of the Uvalde massacre. OFFICER: Come up with me. We've got shots fired in the building. Are we going in? Are we staying here? What are we doing? OFFICER: What the [bleep] is going on? [Bleep]. PROKUPECZ (voice over): It is a firsthand look into a stunning series of law enforcement failures. OFFICER: Okay. Uvalde, they are saying that he's possibly in the building on the -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:       (INAUDIBLE). OFFICER: Oh [bleep]. Shots fired. Get inside. Go, go, go. [GUNSHOTS] OFFICER: Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding? He's in the class. [Bleep]. OFFICER: I've got shots fired. We're going to be in the building. Westside. Dude, we've got to get in there. We have to get in there. He just keeps shooting. We've got to get in there. PROKUPECZ (voice over): But they didn't go in the classroom. Not for another 70 minutes, and that decision let the gunman trap two classes of fourth graders and their teachers. OFFICER: Male subjects in the school on the west side of the building. He is contained. We got multiple officers inside the building at this time. We believe he has barricaded in one of the -- one of the offices. I'm messed up. He is still shooting. PROKUPECZ (voice over): Outside, we hear one of the responding officers, Justin Mendoza on his phone telling a loved one what's happening. JUSTIN MENDOZA, POLICE OFFICER: Hey, I love you. We've got an active shooter at the school. [Bleep] man go [bleep] shooting kids' room. PROKUPECZ (voice over): At 11:43 over the radio, we hear. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:       The classroom should be in session right now. The class should be in session with Miss Mireles. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ID your status. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh no. Oh no. DISPATCH: Uvalde PD. Uvalde PD has just revised 401, stating you've got the shooter in Room 111 or 112. [20:10:06] PROKUPECZ (voice over): Almost 15 minutes later as additional law enforcement arrives, we then hear the officers asking about the kids. OFFICER: Any of those kids? Is there any one hit? OFFICER: No. We don't know anything about that. No kids are -- PROKUPECZ (voice over): Officer Mendoza is left wondering what's going on? OFFICER MENDOZA: Are we just waiting for more tech or what's going on? PROKUPECZ (voice over): Moments later, 45 minutes after the first officers arrived on scene, a critical piece of the puzzle from the camera of Officer Mendoza. 9-1-1 DISPATCH: We have a child on the line. OFFICER: Hey, what was that? 9-1-1 DISPATCH: It's going to be Room 12 (INAUDIBLE). He is a room full of victims. Full of victims at this moment. PROKUPECZ (voice over): 9-1-1 dispatch gives a chilling account from a student still in the classroom. This was the second call the same child made to 9-1-1. The first call was apparently not relayed to these officers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:       Give me some air. Yes. (INAUDIBLE). PROKUPECZ (voice over): Minutes later you can hear a heavily armed SWAT team member still expressing confusion over if there are any kids alive in the room. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:       No one knows about kids or anything else there? PROKUPECZ (voice over): Now realizing the worst case scenario is unfolding, Officer Mendoza prepares for the trauma injuries. OFFICER MENDOZA: I need to grab my med kit for my -- they say there are multiple victims in the room. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, you know where Room 12 is? OFFICER MENDOZA: Room 12? We are in the hundredth -- this is the hundredth building. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: EMT, hey. OFFICER MENDOZA: But supposedly, the victims are here. I am not a hundred percent. There's a bunch of information flying around. PROKUPECZ (voice over): Around the same time on another camera, we hear you have all the School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo is inside attempting to negotiate with the shooter. PETE ARREDONDO, UVALDE SCHOOL POLICE CHIEF:  Sir, if you can hear me, please put your firearm down, sir. We don't want anybody else hurt. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:       We've got kids in there. ARREDONDO:     I know. I know. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:       What are we doing? PROKUPECZ (voice over): Back in the hallway, Officer Mendoza preparing his Medpac. It would still be about 25 minutes of confusion and hesitation until the door was breached. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:       One guy on the radio say who's going to be calling the shots. PROKUPECZ (voice over): The bodycam footage made public ends before we can see a hail of gunfire, when finally at 12:50 local time, 77 minutes after the shooting began, law enforcement go in and kill the gunman. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: I mean, this is the first time seeing that. This is just stunning. You hear that officer early on. I mean, he knows what everybody should be doing. He says it, ""We've got to get in there."" He knows. ""We've got to get in there."" I mean, that is what everybody is trained and has been trained now for decades on that you've got to get in there. It's extraordinary to see this, and you can tell a lot of those officers knew what they wanted to do. But it I mean, the lack of anyone -- is there any sign on this -- on any of these tapes about anybody taking any leadership? I mean, somebody -- this is a scene desperate for leadership. PROKUPECZ: It is, Anderson. It is hard to watch, you know, and there is no leadership. There is no one telling them, ""This is the plan. This is what we need to do. This is where we're going to go."" It seems as though there were some officers that were paralyzed in fear. I mean, when you look at some of this video, and the way they were cowering behind walls, worried about themselves, worried about whether they were going to get shot, not trying to get in that classroom. It's very obvious, there were a lot of officers who were scared. But that one officer -- that one officer, Mendoza, you could feel his anxiety, right? You see him calling a family member, perhaps to tell them that he loves them. He describes it as an active shooter situation. There were other officers who wanted to help. But what happens here is that there was no leadership, there was no plan, no plan. And it's not until sometime later where all of a sudden, and we don't know why, that's the other thing that investigators have not been able to figure out. Why did they decide to go when at the time that they went in? Nothing changed. It was the same exact situation. Why didn't they do it earlier? And so, Officer Mendoza, there are other officers like that there, Anderson and, you know, I thought his story was quite different because you see him moving around, trying to figure out what to do. And like you said, there was just no leadership, there was no one telling them what to do. COOPER: And you know, you use the word ""scared."" It's normal for, you know, people would be scared in this situation, for people, for a police officer to be scared. It's a question of, do you nevertheless, you act your training. You know you have to act despite the fear and that's what training is all about, and that's what leadership is all about, getting people to do stuff in spite of fear, in spite of that adrenaline that's pumping and telling you things. Shimon, I appreciate the reporting as always. A day after the shooting, I spoke with, in Uvalde with Angel Garza, whose stepdaughter Amerie Jo was murdered at Robb Elementary just a week and a half after she had celebrated her 10th birthday. I spoke with him tonight just before the School Board meeting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: Angel, this report that was released over the weekend, hearing about the myriad failures that took place, and there is still obviously a lot to learn. What do you think when you saw that report? ANGEL GARZA, STEPDAUGHTER WAS KILLED IN ROBB ELEMENTARY SHOOTING: It's just -- it was just disappointment. I mean, it's -- so I guess, clarification that stuff we already knew, like, getting the clarification does make it a little harder. All of this stuff is hard every time something comes out, it's just like reliving the situation over and over again. COOPER: How have you gotten through the last few weeks? GARZA: My wife, my son, and actually the parents of the other family -- the families of the rest of the victims, we actually all have come together and spoken to one another and we've really become a family of our own and we help each other as much as we can. COOPER: I don't think I've ever reported on a tragedy like this, in which the families have been kept in the dark for so long by everyone it seems, and even at this stage, the lack of answers, do you feel that? I mean, at this stage, what does accountability look like for you? GARZA: Everybody says that. People will tell me that they've never seen anything like this, you know, agencies arguing amongst each other, trying to point the finger on who did this and who did what? I mean, Highland Park happened to after us and we already know everything about that. We know everything -- all. I mean, we know everything. So, it makes no sense that there are still things that aren't answered about this. It's humiliating to us. It makes us feel like our kids can't rest in peace. All this arguing and bickering and lying to our face, it doesn't help our situation at all. COOPER: Do you believe that the truth will come out in the end? GARZA: I guess that's all that, us, parents are hoping for. We will -- we want to, you know, fight until we do get the answers that we're looking for. We deserve that. Our children deserve that. That's really what it's about. We just -- we want our babies to rest in peace, we want to know so we can grieve properly, so we can try to move forward and try to start a new normal. I mean, nobody is ever going to be the same after this. COOPER: One of the officials a couple of weeks ago was sort of cornered by one of our reporters, Shimon Prokupecz, and one of the things he said to our reporter was that he would speak and release information once the family's stopped grieving. And when I heard that, I thought, well, that's -- there is never going to be a time when that pain is not there. I'm wondering if you heard him say that and what you thought when you heard that? GARZA: I actually didn't. I wasn't aware of that. I mean, hearing -- I think, us, parents think that hearing people you know, release information or keep information, they're doing it for us. It's complete lie. If they have information and they want to tell us, as a family, then tell us as a family. Don't release it to the public -- don't, you know try to get recognition off of a situation like that because that just humiliates us like, we lost our children. This isn't something that you know, somebody shouldn't be gaining anything off of. COOPER: You're about to go into the first School Board meeting, since your daughter Amerie Jo was killed. What do you hope will happen there? What are you expecting? [20:20:03] GARZA: I'm expecting actually a lot of angry parents. Apparently, there was chances to, you know, fix the security system or fix the locks at least and they were just ignored. And a lot of parents are pretty upset about that. So I expect a lot of parents just to give them a piece of their mind. Hopefully they listen. Everybody, you know, says that they wanted to help us. If they listen to us, and they, you know, make change, then that'll definitely give us some type of happiness. COOPER: The first day of the new school year in Uvalde was supposed to be four weeks from today. I understand that's going to be announced tonight that it won't be until September now. In your mind has anything at all changed to make parents feel safe to send their kids back to school? GARZA: Absolutely not. I feel, if anything, I mean, it's getting worse by the lack of, you know, knowledge, the lack of -- it just seems like urgency. I mean, everybody says like, this is going to take time, this is going to take time, but I mean, we're in what mid -- almost end of July. I mean, school is going to be here before they know it and nobody wants to send their children to school after this. I mean, who would want to send their children to school? Like, I sent Amerie to school that morning thinking I was going to pick her up that day. So who's going to be comfortable enough to know that their child is going to be okay for them to pick them up that day? COOPER: You have a son? Will you be sending him to school given where things stand or how do you make those choices? GARZA: As of right now, our son -- our son will probably be homeschooled. He is not going to be going to school right now. That's something that we're dealing with now. He's having a lot of just separation issues himself. So we just want to take care of our family right now, and all the other families that were affected by this. COOPER: Angel Garza, I really appreciate talking to you and I wish your family continued strength in the days ahead. GARZA: Thank you, Mr. Cooper. There's one thing I want to add before I let you guys go. There's been a lot of confusion on the subject of Amerie and her biological father. I'm not Amerie's biological father. I've never claimed to be Amerie's biological father. Amerie has a biological father and she knew she had a father and she loves him. I will never try to discredit anyone in this situation at all. I refer to myself as ""Daddy"" because I earned that. She called me that. The morning I dropped her off she said, ""I love you, Daddy."" That's the only reason I refer to myself as ""Daddy"" because I've been with Kimberly since she was eight months old and she's lived at this the entire time. So I just wanted to clear up the air for anybody. I'm not trying to discredit anyone. I'm just a grieving stepfather. COOPER: I understand. That's certainly not a question we ever raised, but I understand, maybe somebody did a long time ago and I think it's very clear how your relationship. Angel Garza, thank you so much. GARZA: Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: Next tonight, more from Uvalde and what is being said about at tonight's emotional School Board meeting. And later, a look ahead of a very big week in the January 6th investigation, what Select Committee is planning for its primetime hearing, a season finale of sorts, but with the promise of more to come. Also, Steve Bannon goes to trial. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:28:25] COOPER: Tonight's school board meeting in Uvalde been wrenching for so many reasons. If only for the simple fact watching kids standing up and talking about the friends who were taken from them and the existential terror they now face. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My daughter has something to say. GIRL: This was the last dress that all my friends saw me on. Most of those kids were my friends, and that's not good. And I don't want to go to your guys' school if they don't have protection. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And she's encouraging for her friends not to go to school, too. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Joining us now, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe. Andrew, watching this body camera footage and reading this report, which just illustrates failure after failure. I'm wondering what stands out to you from a law enforcement perspective. ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Sure, so, you know, there are so many mistakes and failures and indicators of poor training or incompetence or all kinds of issues in all these videos. But honestly, for me, Anderson, almost all of this can be traced back in some way to the core failure of leadership, and all of that washes up on the feet of Chief Arredondo. Yes, there are people, there are others who should be held accountable as well. Law enforcement leaders from other agencies who were there and didn't take charge. First responders who were there knew what was going on, but didn't buck the system and push back against, you know the chain of command and take action themselves. They should have done all of those things. [20:30:11] But let's be clear, those are second and third order impacts. None of that would have even been necessary, had Chief Arredondo put in place the most basic reasonable structures of leadership and exhibited some of the most general, you know, generally accepted leadership approaches that we expect of all law enforcement leaders today. COOPER: You know, according to this report, Chief Arredondo claims he thought he was not in command. He also didn't have his radios on him. He didn't learn about the 911 calls allegedly from victims in the classrooms because of his, quote, failure to establish reliable method of receiving critical information from outside the building. The fact that he -- I mean, does that make any sense to you? I don't understand. Aren't you supposed to sort of form a incident, you know, command station outside the building? Why is he, the guy, going through keys if he's the chief? MCCABE: It's inexplicable, Anderson. I mean, he said he didn't think he was in charge. But yet in that same statement, he admitted that he knew the policy was that he was in charge. He didn't have his radios with him, not because he forgot them, which is the kind of mistake anybody could make. But because he chose not to take them. He thought they were too awkward or heavy and didn't want to have to run with them or something. I mean, it's incomprehensible the decisions that this man made at the point in his life when it was most important to make good decisions. Had he done the reasonable and accepted thing of establishing incident command, establishing a command post outside of the tactical scene, bringing the other law enforcement leaders in there to share in the most recent intelligence and to understand who brought what resources to the table and make decisions and deploy officers, which is what any law enforcement leader would do. Instead, we see him for minutes on end, in the school trying one key after another on a door that --  COOPER: Yes. MCCABE: -- apparently he didn't even really need to open. So it's inexplicable. COOPER: Do you have any doubt these videos and then there's been controversy -- you know, obviously, understandably, parents are upset about how they were leaked, and all of that, and that is totally understandable -- do you have any doubt that these videos will for years to come, be used and shown to every police officer going through training in active shooter situations in a case study of what not to do? MCCABE: I have no doubt, Anderson. 10, 20, 30 years from now, every new agent in the FBI Academy, every police trainee at a police academies across the country will be at some point sitting in a classroom watching these videos in which -- and there'll be pointed out every single mistake that was made. And hopefully told that if you find yourself in a situation like this, and you would be inclined to make the same decisions, it's time to leave now. This is not the job for you. COOPER: Andrew McCabe, appreciate your time. Thank you. We are just getting news --  MCCABE: Thanks. COOPER: -- of a new witness called by the January 6 committee for Thursday's hearing to be held in primetime. We'll tell you who that is. We'll also discuss some new reporting about another attorney who made his way into the former president's orbit and was urging him to declare martial law. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:37:07] COOPER: Just learned a new witness for the House January 6 committee. He is Matthew Pottinger, who served on the former President's National Security Council. According to a number of sources familiar with committee plans, Pottinger is expected to testify publicly at Thursday's primetime hearing alongside former White House aide Sarah Matthews. Also just in, Committee Chair Bennie Thompson on whether or not the former president and vice president will end up on the witness list. Here's what he told CNN's Manu Raju. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Has the committee made a decision on whether to subpoena Mike Pence or try to call Donald Trump to come testify? REP. BENNIE THOMPSON, CHAIRMAN, JANUARY 6 SELECT COMMITTEE: Not yet. Not yet. RAJU: What is -- what's the hang up here? THOMPSON: I don't know hang up. We just have made a decision. RAJU: What's your view on that? THOMPSON: I think we would benefit from their testimony. But we have a committee and --  RAJU: For Pence and Trump? THOMPSON: And both. Yes, I mean, they both have, I would think, significant knowledge about what goes on. But we have a committee and we will work through the process with the committee. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: Thursday's primetime hearings expect to focus on what the former president was doing and not doing for more than three hours as the assault on the Capitol unfolded. Based on what we've seen up to this point, it also appears that Thursday will count the case the committee has been making all along about the former president's culpability in a far larger, far broader scheme beyond just what happened on the 6th to overturn the election. Here to talk about it, as well as the contempt trial of Steve Bannon, which is just getting underway, Daniel Goldman, he's a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. He served, you all recall, as general counsel for the House Intelligence Committee during the first impeachment. We should also add, he's running for Congress here in New York and for the 10th District. Thanks for being here. DANIEL GOLDMAN, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF N.Y.: Thanks for having me. COOPER: I'm wondering, just having -- given your experience, what jumps out to you from what you have seen thus far with the committee? GOLDMAN: Well, it is so nice to have two and a half hours of uninterrupted time to do whatever you want as a congressional committee and not have the five minute rule going back and forth. But what they have done is used it brilliantly and in such a compelling way to paint a picture of chapters basically of what occurred and focusing on different aspects of it. And they've brought to life so much of some of what we saw, but so much of what we didn't know. So that we are now left with a really clear picture, not only about what happened on January 6, but on the run up to January 6, and what looks exactly like a conspiracy to overturn the election that was centered around Donald Trump and his inner orbit of rogue operators who were feeding him lies and that he understood to be lies. COOPER: There's been questions about the sharing of the information that the committee has gathered with the Department of Justice. Does it make sense to you that what's going on there because the committee seems to sort of be saying, well, look, we don't have the time to collate all this information and get it to the Department of Justice, is this like a turf war? [20:40:07] GOLDMAN: None of the interactions between the Department of Justice and the committee makes a ton of sense, in large part because the Department of Justice is usually the body that is racing out in front because they don't want anyone else, any of their witnesses to testify under oath elsewhere because it creates all sorts of disclosure issues. COOPER: Right. GOLDMAN: And they're not maybe aren't asking the questions that they would ask or any testimony changes by a little bit. But they clearly allowed the committee to go forward first, and they lag behind the Department of Justice. And then right as the committee is nearing their sort of climax of hearings, that is the culmination of a incredibly intensive investigation of 1,000 witnesses, then the department asks for the transcripts and all of their evidence and they said, hold on, what they have done brilliantly is not released any of the transcripts to anyone, the public or otherwise. So what we're -- we are seeing them for the first time these interviews and depositions, and I think they just said let's do our hearings and then we'll give you the materials. Ultimately, they will cooperate. COOPER: The New York Times is reporting that in December 2020, this conservative attorney little known guy named William Olson was advising the former president encouraging him to overturn the election and Olson was pushing, according to the Times, the foreign president takes steps that he himself said would be viewed as martial law. Can you believe this stuff? GOLDMAN: I just don't know where Donald Trump finds these lawyers who have such outrageously incorrect and illegal views who acknowledge that it's martial law yet I'm going to encourage it. And, you know, that flies in the face of the White House Counsel, the Attorney General, his own campaign lawyers, his own White House lawyers, I mean, everyone understood that after December 14th, there was no more legal challenge. So everything that occurred after December 14th was outside of any proper legal proceedings. And it was almost like let's just find anybody we can who can come up with a more cockamamie theory to overturn the election, which is ultimately what his goal was. COOPER: You're running for the 10th District, what are the -- what's the big issue for you? GOLDMAN: Well, a huge issue is the threats that Donald Trump is still posing to our democracy. He is with his acolytes in the Republican Party changing laws around the country to correct for what he perceives to be the problems with their effort to steal the 2020 election. So now, they're out there changing these laws, allowing elected officials to overturn the will of the people. COVID: So there may not be in the future a Brad Raffensperger who's willing to buck the president? GOLDMAN: Well, the law would just be that a elected official can overturn an election if there are allegations of fraud. There doesn't have to be evidence. This is unbelievably anti-democratic. And given my experience on the impeachment hearings, and challenging and taking on Donald Trump, I am running on the primarily on the principle that we need to defend our democracy. COOPER: Daniel Goldman, appreciate it. Thanks so much. GOLDMAN: Thanks so much. COOPER: Appreciate it. Coming up, a story of miracles and betrayal after a woman who was brutally attacked wakes up from a years-long coma, which is remarkable enough and then names her brother as a culprit. The details ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:47:05] COOPER: An amazing story I want to tell you about now, West Virginia woman who was brutally attacked woke up after more than two years in a coma and named her brother as her attacker. Now according to the Jackson County Sheriff's Department, in June 2021, the Palmer was, quote, attacked, hacked and left for dead. Jackson County Sheriff's as she is now coherent, unable to hold full-length conversations. Her brother has denied any involvement in the attacks. CNN's Jean Casarez has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Daniel Palmer III was anything by cooperative as law enforcement tried to get him to jail after an initial court proceeding on Friday. Palmer of Jackson County, West Virginia is now charged with the attempted murder of his sister Wanda in June of 2020. Allegedly bludgeoning her with a hatchet or axe according to the sheriff. It was Wanda's mother who called 911 after it happened. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They came Wednesday morning to mow her grass. And they found her at a big pool of blood they said and they run up on the hill real fast on a four-wheeler and told us and I called the police and the ambulance. CASAREZ (voice-over): Wanda was found in her living room. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We show up and we see her on the couch, bloodied, battered, bludgeoned in the head and face area. CASAREZ (voice-over): They believed she was dead. But then heard sounds, quote, commonly referred to as the death rattle. But Wanda was alive. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn't have wagered a nickel for her life that morning. She wasn't that bad a shape. CASAREZ (voice-over): According to the criminal complaint, a witness, Wanda's brother had her trailer that night. And investigators say there was a history of violence between them. But law enforcement had no weapon, no eyewitness to the attack, and no phone records or video. And Wanda was in a coma. Until about three weeks ago, when she woke up in her nursing home, the sheriff says, and she told investigators the attacker that night was her own brother. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For her to be able to wake up and say, you know, give the name, thank God. That's all I can say. Thank God. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This case is really about the perseverance and the toughness on the strength of the victim in itself. (END VIDEOTAPE) CASAREZ (voice-over): And Palmer has been held on $500,000 bail. The court clerk's office told me today that he does not have an attorney yet because he is refusing to sign the paperwork. And Anderson, the sheriff had told us early on that she was only able to give one word responses, yes or no, to any question. Late today, they're telling us that she can do primitive speaking. Gave us an example. Why would your brother want to do this to you? Mean, because mean. So everyone is hoping that she's getting better because she will be and would be the star witness of a prosecutor. COOPER: Yes. Jean Casarez, thanks so much. Really appreciate it. Coming up, the latest on Sunday's mall shooting in Indiana with the FBI found in the oven of the suspect's apartment and more on bystander being hailed as a hero. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:53:57] COOPER: As we were learning more about the events surrounding the Uvalde shooting on Sunday, there was another mass shooting, this time at a mall food court in Indiana. Three people killed. Today, authorities said the suspect had three weapons including two rifles. They say he only used one of them, an AR-15 style rifle. Also, the FBI says it is analyzing a laptop found in the oven of the suspect's apartment, plus a cell phone found in a toilet near the bathroom near the food court. We're also learning more on the illegally armed bystander who shot and killed the shooter who today is being hailed as a hero. CNN's Omar Jimenez has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's become an almost familiar scene of evacuation in America. HEATHER ARTHUR, WITNESS: So we were in the food court and we heard loud gunshots. JIMENEZ (voice-over): As an Indiana shopping mall quickly became among the latest settings for a mass shooting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Mayor. JIMENEZ (voice-over): Today, the police chief announced the findings of their investigation, including the movements of the gunman. CHIEF JAMES ISON, GREENWOOD POLICE: He walks directly to the food court restroom. One hour and two minutes later, he exits the restroom and shoot Inspector Gomez outside of the restroom. He then points his rifle into the food court where Pedro and Rosa Pineda were eating dinner, and shot both Rosa and Pedro. [20:55:14] JIMENEZ (voice-over): According to police, the gunman shot and killed three people Sunday evening using a rifle, Victor Gomez, Rosa Rivera de Pineda and Pedro Pineda. Police say he injured at least two others, including a 12-year-old girl. And then police say less than two minutes after the shooting began, the attacker was killed by a, quote, Good Samaritan with a lawfully carried gun. ISON: The shooter fired several rounds striking the suspect. The suspect attempted to retrieve -- retreat back into the restroom and fail. I will say his actions were nothing short of heroic. He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun, was very proficient in that, very tactically sound. And as he moved to close in on the suspect, he was also motioning for people to exit behind him. JIMENEZ (voice-over): Police say the 22-year-old Elisjsha Dicken doesn't appear to have any police or military background, but fired his weapon at least 10 times based on handgun rounds recovered at the scene. Stopping a gunman with another gun is relatively rare. According to data from Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University, there have been at least 434 active shooter attacks between 2000 and 2021. Of those, just 22 ended with an armed bystanders shooting the attacker. And of those 22, 10 were either from a security guard or off duty officer. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ: Now that Good Samaritan, Elisjsha Dicken was neither an off duty officer nor a security guard. He's 22 years old from Seymour, Indiana about an hour south of Indianapolis less than an hour from here. He fired 10 shots during this. The gunman fired 24 shots, according to rounds recovered from the scene. But this gunman was armed at the very least with the rifle and a pistol with more than 100 rounds of ammunition. So the intent here seem to be do a lot more damage in the tragic life -- loss of life we saw anyway. COOPER: Right. JIMENEZ: But again, when you look at that alert data, it's incredibly rare for a bystander with a gun to stop an active shooter. But that's exactly what happened here, and was part of why he's being hailed as a hero. COOPER: Yes. Omar Jimenez, appreciate it. Thank you. We'll be right back.
