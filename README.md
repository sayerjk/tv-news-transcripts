# tv-news-transcripts

Many TV networks post their daily news show transcripts online, and have been doing so for many years. The goldmine here would be finding matching phrases and sentiments being pushed across different networks at uniform dates and times. For this, later implementation of NLTK's bigrams and trigrams extraction functions will be used. The plan is to compare shows on the same network, on different networks, and sentiment/subjectivity metrics over a long period of time. Additionally, to find matching phrases, comparision of found phrases across shows during similar datetimes will be needed. Visualizations may help here, and topic analysis may provide more insight if exact phrases are not matching. However, despite the large volume of text per doucment, topic analysis may prove inaccurate for finding matching phrases since the way it divides topics (LDA topic modeling) often yields indistinct categories, despite the computer insisting distinct differences.
